Though the complaints came down to\n402 cases in 2023 and 370 in 2024, officials, all\nthe same, point out that many cases go\nunreported due to fear, social stigma, and lack\nof awareness.\nA senior official from the department stated\nthat more cases were reported in urban areas,\nlargely due to greater awareness of legal aid\noptions. Women in these areas usually seek\nhelp through helplines such as 181 or by filing\npetitions. \u201cWe try to resolve cases through the\nOne Stop Centre, where senior counsellors\nprovide guidance. If a resolution is not\npossible, cases are forwarded to the special\ncourt dealing with domestic violence cases,\u201d\nthe official said.\nApart from the Social Welfare Department,\ndomestic violence cases are also handled at\nAll-Women Police Stations (AWPS) in the city.\nA senior police department official said over\n50% of the cases reported at AWPS were\nresolved through counselling sessions. Cases\ninvolving physical harassment or prolonged\nverbal abuse were forwarded to the court, a\nwoman Inspector said.\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/domestic-violence-p\u2026amilies-ruin-resolution-scope-say-conciliators/article69303082.ece Page 2 of 4\nDomestic violence persists as nuclear families ruin resolution scope, say conciliators - The Hindu 16/05/25, 15:47\nAdvocate M. Vennila, who takes up domestic\nviolence cases, pointed out that several factors\ncontributed to the issue, including lack of\nunderstanding and morality, alcohol\nconsumption, and the crumbling of joint\nfamily system. She explained that\nmisunderstandings and lack of mutual respect\noften escalated into conflicts and violence,\nwhile alcohol consumption further worsened\nthe situation by leading to aggression and loss\nof self-control.\nAdditionally, the shift away from joint families\nhad removed a traditional support system\nwhere elders acted as mediators during\ndisputes. In nuclear families, conflicts often\nremained unresolved, leaving women more\nvulnerable to domestic violence without\nimmediate familial intervention, she said.\nMs. Vennila noted that while legal frameworks\nexisted to protect women, delays in case\nresolution often made the process ineffective.\nShe also raised concerns about privacy\nviolations during case investigations. \u201cWhen\ndomestic violence cases are recorded, there\nhave been instances where women\u2019s problems\nbecome known, leading to their further\nharassment by the very perpetrators, further\naffecting their privacy,\u201d she said.\nAs a mediator, she observed that there were\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/domestic-violence-p\u2026amilies-ruin-resolution-scope-say-conciliators/article69303082.ece Page 3 of 4\nDomestic violence persists as nuclear families ruin resolution scope, say conciliators - The Hindu 16/05/25, 15:47\nnumerous instances of couples choosing to\nskip the counselling intervention and\nproceeding directly for a divorce settlement.\n\u201cAs a result, children are affected. Today\u2019s\nsocial media creates unrealistic expectations,\nleading to misunderstandings. Tolerance and\nacceptance levels are declining, and in the end,\nwomen remain the most affected by domestic\nviolence,\u201d she said.\nPublished - March 07, 2025 10:19 pm IST\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/domestic-violence-p\u2026amilies-ruin-resolution-scope-say-conciliators/article69303082.ece Page 4 of 4"

Perpetrators\noften use physical force, their body or other objects to injure the girl or\nwoman. It does not always leave visible marks or scars. Do not\nunderestimate or ignore what is happening to you, because, over time,\nthe violence usually gets worse.\nhttps://www.snehamumbai.org/domestic-violence/ 1/8\n23/05/2025, 16:45 Domestic Violence Support and Resources | SNEHA\n1.

a complex issue, and there are various factors that can contribute to its occurrence.\nSome of the most common causes of domestic violence include:\nPower and control: Domestic violence often involves one person exerting power and control over another, which can manifest in physical, emotional,\nsexual, or financial abuse.\nTrauma and mental health issues: People who have experienced trauma or who struggle with mental health issues may be more likely to perpetrate\ndomestic violence.\nSubstance abuse or addiction: Substance abuse (https://www.talktoangel.com/area-of-expertise/addiction), particularly drugs or alcohol, can increase the\nlikelihood of domestic violence.\nLearned behavior: Individuals who grew up in abusive households may be more likely to perpetrate domestic violence themselves.\nSocietal norms: Some cultures and communities may have norms that condone or even encourage domestic violence, making it more likely to occur.\nIt's important to remember that domestic violence is never the fault of the victim, and there is no excuse for abusive behavior. Domestic violence can\ncause physical harm, emotional trauma, and psychological distress. And in such cases, online counselling (https://www.talktoangel.com/therapists) can\nhelp victims of domestic violence to cope with the trauma, build their self-esteem (https://www.talktoangel.com/teen-counselling/low-self-esteem-and-\nconfidence), and develop a sense of empowerment.\nhttps://www.talktoangel.com/area-of-expertise/domestic-violence 9/16\n23/05/2025, 16:49 Domestic Violence | Online Domestic Abuse Counselling | TalktoAngel\nDomestic violence, also known as intimate partner violence (IPV), refers to any form of physical, emotional, psychological, or sexual abuse that occurs\nwithin a close relationship, such as between spouses, partners, or family members.\nHere are some key issues related to domestic violence:\n(https://www.talktoangel.com)\nPower and Control: Domestic violence is often driven by a desire for power and control over another person. Abusers use a variety of tactics to maintain\nthis power, including physical violence, emotional abuse (https://www.talktoangel.com/area-of-expertise/emotional-abuse), isolation, and financial\ncontrol.\nGender-Based Violence: Domestic violence is often gender-based, with women being disproportionately affected by it. Men are more likely to perpetrate\nacts of violence against their female partners, and women are more likely to experience severe and long-lasting effects of the abuse.\nThe cycle of Violence: Domestic violence often follows a cycle of violence, which includes a period of tension building, an acute incident of violence, and a\nperiod of reconciliation. This cycle can repeat itself over and over again, making it difficult for victims to leave the abusive relationship.\nTrauma and Mental Health: Domestic violence can cause significant trauma and mental health issues for victims, including depression\n(https://www.talktoangel.com/area-of-expertise/depression), anxiety (https://www.talktoangel.com/area-of-expertise/anxiety), post-traumatic stress\ndisorder (https://www.talktoangel.com/area-of-expertise/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd) (PTSD), and substance abuse\n(https://www.talktoangel.com/area-of-expertise/addiction).\nLegal and Social Barriers: Victims of domestic violence may face legal and social barriers to leaving their abuser, including fears of retaliation, financial\ndependence, and lack of access to resources and support.\nBarriers to leaving: Victims of domestic violence often face many barriers to leaving their abusers, including financial dependence, fear of retaliation, lack\nof social support, and cultural or religious beliefs that discourage divorce or separation.\nIt is important to recognize domestic violence as a serious issue that requires urgent attention and action. Effective prevention and intervention strategies\nfor domestic violence include education and awareness-raising, legal protections for victims, counseling and support services, and accountability for\nabusers through the criminal justice system. There are resources available to help, including online counselling (https://www.talktoangel.com/therapists)\nservices, government helpline numbers, and shelters for domestic violence victims.\nDomestic violence is a complex issue with many challenges, both for victims and for those working to prevent and address it.\nSome of the challenges in domestic violence include:\nLack of reporting: Many victims of domestic violence do not report the abuse they are experiencing, either because they are afraid of retaliation, believe\nthat the abuse is their fault, or feel ashamed or embarrassed.\nLimited resources: There may be limited resources available to victims of domestic violence, such as shelters or legal services, which can make it difficult\nfor them to escape abusive situations.\nSocietal attitudes: Societal attitudes that blame victims or excuse the behavior of abusers can make it difficult for victims to come forward and seek help.\nChildren and Domestic Violence: Children who witness domestic violence can experience trauma and long-lasting effects on their emotional and\npsychological development. They may also be at increased risk of becoming victims or perpetrators of violence in their own relationships later in life.\nIntersectionality: Domestic violence intersects with other forms of oppression, including racism, ableism, and homophobia. People from marginalized\ncommunities, such as LGBTQ+ individuals, people with disabilities, and people of color, may face additional barriers to accessing support and resources.\nLegal challenges: Legal barriers, such as difficulty obtaining restraining orders or navigating the court system, can make it difficult for victims to obtain\njustice or protection.\nLack of education: Many people do not understand what domestic violence is, how it impacts victims, or how to prevent it, which can make it more\ndifficult to address the problem.\nhttps://www.talktoangel.com/area-of-expertise/domestic-violence 10/16\n23/05/2025, 16:49 Domestic Violence | Online Domestic Abuse Counselling | TalktoAngel\n(https://www.talktoangel.com)\nFaced by Person:\nPhysical Injuries\nIsolation and Loneliness (https://www.talktoangel.com/area-of-expertise/loneliness)\nEmotional Trauma\nFear and Phobia (https://www.talktoangel.com/area-of-expertise/phobia)\nFinancial Stress\nHousing and Homelessness\nChild custody\nFaced by Family:\nSafety Concerns\nStrained Relationships\nCaretaking Responsibilities\nStigma and Shame\nLegal Challenges\nDomestic Violence\nhttps://www.talktoangel.com/area-of-expertise/domestic-violence 11/16\n23/05/2025, 16:49 Domestic Violence | Online Domestic Abuse Counselling | TalktoAngel\nTreatment Of Domestic Violence\nD(homttepstsi:c/ /vwiolwenwce.t ias lak steoriaonusg aenl.dc ocomm)plex issue that requires a multifaceted approach. Treatment for domestic violence typically involves a combination\nof interventions including counselling and online therapy to address the needs of the victim and the perpetrator.\nHere are some common approaches:\nSafety planning for the victim: The first priority in domestic violence cases is the safety of the victim. Safety planning involves creating a plan with the\nhelp of legal experts, mental health professionals, or relationship counsellor (https://www.talktoangel.com/best-relationship-counsellor-near-me) to help\nthe victim protect themselves and their children from further harm.\nIndividual therapy for the victim: Therapy can help the victim deal with the emotional impact of domestic violence and build coping skills. Therapy or\nonline counselling (https://www.talktoangel.com/therapists) can also help the victim identify and address any underlying mental health issues such as\ntrauma (https://www.talktoangel.com/area-of-expertise/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd), loneliness (https://www.talktoangel.com/area-of-\nexpertise/loneliness), emotional abuse (https://www.talktoangel.com/area-of-expertise/emotional-abuse), stress (https://www.talktoangel.com/area-of-\nexpertise/stress), depression (https://www.talktoangel.com/area-of-expertise/depression), and relationship problems (https://www.talktoangel.com/area-\nof-expertise/relationship).\nGroup therapy for the victim: Group therapy can provide a supportive environment where the victim can connect with others who have experienced\nsimilar situations. Group therapy (https://www.talktoangel.com/therapies/group-therapy) can help the victim to build a sense of community, reduce\nisolation, and increase self-esteem (https://www.talktoangel.com/teen-counselling/low-self-esteem-and-confidence).\nCounseling for the perpetrator: Counselling can help the perpetrator to take responsibility for their actions, address any underlying issues that may be\ncontributing to their behavior, and learn new, healthy ways of relating to others.\nAnger management classes: Anger management classes can help the perpetrator learn how to manage their anger in a healthy way, rather than using\nviolence or intimidation to control their partner.\nLegal interventions: Legal interventions, such as restraining orders or criminal charges, may be necessary to protect the victim and hold the perpetrator\naccountable for their actions.\nDomestic violence is a serious issue that affects millions of people worldwide. It can be physical, emotional, or sexual abuse that occurs within a family or\nintimate relationship.\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, there are several steps that can be taken to manage the situation.\nSafety first: The first and most important step is to ensure the safety of the victim and any children involved. If you are in immediate danger, call the\npolice or emergency services in your area. If you need to leave your home, find a safe place to go, such as a shelter or the home of a trusted friend or\nfamily member.\nSeek professional help: Domestic violence is a complex issue that often requires professional assistance. Contact a local domestic violence organization,\ntherapist, or online counsellor (https://www.talktoangel.com/therapists) for guidance and support. They can provide resources, such as counseling, legal\nassistance, and shelter, to help you manage the situation.\nDevelop a safety plan: A safety plan is a personalized plan of action to help keep you and your family safe. This plan can include things like having a code\nword or signal to indicate danger, knowing the location of important documents, and identifying safe places to go if you need to leave quickly.\nDocument the abuse: It's important to document any instances of emotional abuse (https://www.talktoangel.com/area-of-expertise/emotional-abuse) or\nphysical violence, including the date, time, and location, as well as any injuries sustained. This documentation can be used as evidence if you decide to\npursue legal action against the perpetrator.\nConsider legal action: Depending on the severity of the abuse, you may want to consider seeking a restraining order or pressing charges against the\nperpetrator. A lawyer or legal aid organization can provide guidance on the legal options available to you.\nReach out for support: Domestic violence can be an isolating and traumatic experience. Reach out to trusted friends and family members, or the best\npsychologist in India (https://www.talktoangel.com/best-therapists-in-india) for emotional support. Joining a support group can also be helpful in\nconnecting with others who have had similar experiences.\nDomestic Violence\nTherapies For Domestic Violence\n\uf0da Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR) Therapy (https://www.talktoangel.com/therapies/eye-\nmovement-desensitisation-and-reprocessing-emdr-therapy)\n\uf0da Person-Centred Therapy (https://www.talktoangel.com/therapies/person-centred-therapy)\n\uf0da Solution-Focused Brief Therapy (https://www.talktoangel.com/therapies/solution-focused-brief-therapy)\n\uf0da Art Therapy (https://www.talktoangel.com/therapies/art-therapy)\n\uf0da Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) (https://www.talktoangel.com/therapies/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt)\nhttps://www.talktoangel.com/area-of-expertise/domestic-violence 12/16\n23/05/2025, 16:49 Domestic Violence | Online Domestic Abuse Counselling | TalktoAngel\nBenefits Of Online Counselling For Domestic Violence\n(https://www.talktoangel.com)\nOnline Counselling (https://www.talktoangel.com/therapists) for domestic violence can be a crucial part of the healing and recovery process for\nindividuals who have experienced domestic violence.

Given the complexity of\nidentifying and addressing intimate partner violence, Sneha Shashidhara discusses the\napplication of machine learning techniques in this context. While recognising the potential of\nthis technology, she also highlights ethical concerns and the need for clear guidelines and\nsafeguards.\nTTwweeeett tthhiiss\nDomestic violence (DV) is a widespread issue that affects communities all over the world,\ncausing immense suffering for victims who often feel isolated. The World Health Organization\n(WHO) reports that one in three women globally will experience some form of domestic abuse\nin their lives. This issue is even more common in South Asian countries like India, where\ngender norms and cultural practices often reinforce the subordination of women from a young\nage.\nIn India, traditional gender roles and a deeply patriarchal society, combined with the societal\npreference for male children, create a toxic environment where women are systematically\nmarginalised and disempowered. Cultural norms such as dowry and child marriage further\nexacerbate the lack of agency among women, perpetuating cycles of abuse and inequality. The\nstaggering statistics from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), 2015-16, reveal that\nalmost 30% of Indian women aged 15-49 have experienced DV in just one year, highlighting the\nurgent need for effective interventions.\nThe power of machine learning\nUnderstanding that intimate partner violence (IPV) is complex and hard to tackle, researchers\nare exploring new solutions like machine learning (ML). ML uses large amounts of data to\ncreate computer models to find patterns or predict future events. These techniques are useful\nfor identifying risk factors for DV and determining how likely someone is to be a victim or\nperpetrator. Studies have shown that ML is better at predicting risky behaviour because it can\nanalyse multiple factors at once and see how they interact, even in complicated ways\n(Simonian et al. 2019, Sundstr\u00f6m and Sch\u00f6n 2020). Unlike traditional methods, ML does not\nneed the data to follow strict rules. For example, ML can look at various factors like\nsocioeconomic status, past violence, substance abuse, and social interactions to predict the\nrisk of future IPV. This allows for more accurate identification of high-risk individuals or\nsituations, leading to better-targeted interventions and prevention strategies.\nHowever, models trained with a small dataset can be unreliable and may not work well in\ndifferent situations. To make them more reliable, it is important to keep the training data\nseparate from the testing data. Cross-validation is a method that improves accuracy by\ntraining the model multiple times with different data splits and then averaging the results. An\nideal accuracy score is 1.0, and anything above 0.5 means the model is better than random\nguessing.\nhttps://www.ideasforindia.in/topics/social-identity/harnessing-machine-learning-to-combat-domestic-violence-in-india.html 2/5\n23/05/2025, 16:43 Harnessing machine learning to combat domestic violence in India\nMachine learning in the context of intimate partner violence\nStudies such as by Capaldi et al. (2012) have sorted the risk factors of intimate partner violence\nIPV into four main categories: individual traits (like age1, history of abuse, and mental health),\nrelationship dynamics (such as infidelity), community factors (like poverty), and societal (legal\nframework, gender and social norms). Amusa et al. (2020) used ML to predict factors\ncontributing to IPV by interviewing 1,816 married women in South Africa. They found that fear\nof the husband was the strongest indicator of experiencing IPV. McDougal et al. (2021)\nemployed ML to uncover new factors affecting Marital Sexual Violence (MSV) in India. Their\n\u2018neural network model\u2019 pointed to elements like exposure to violence, sexual behaviour,\ndecision-making power, and socioeconomic status.\nWe developed machine learning models to predict IPV using data from 66,013 women in the\nNational Family Health Survey (NFHS), 2015-16 (Shashidhara et al. 2024). Our model correctly\nidentifies 78% of actual IPV cases in the test sample. One of our models focuses only on less\nsensitive questions, excluding questions like the woman's perception of her husband\u2019s\nattitudes and behaviours, which is likely to result in more honest answers. This model could be\nused by field health workers to identify women who are at higher risk of experiencing IPV.\nOur model finds that the strongest predictors of IPV are the husband's alcohol use and a\nhistory of violence in the wife\u2019s family, where her mother also experienced IPV. Alcohol impairs\njudgment and self-control, increases financial stress, and makes peaceful conflict resolution\nless likely. Additionally, women who believe it is acceptable for their partner to be violent in\ncertain situations, like neglecting children, arguing, cooking mistakes, or leaving the house, are\nmore likely to experience IPV.\nSigns that the husband is controlling, like controlling money, keeping track of where the wife\ngoes, or limiting her friends, often mean violence could happen. This controlling behaviour\nmight be to make the wife feel like she has no freedom or cannot exit the relationship. It could\nalso be because the husband thinks the wife is cheating. Other things like being poor, having\nless education, or living in hot places also make it more likely for violence to happen.\nEthical considerations and safeguards\nWhile ML shows promise in predicting and preventing IPV, it also brings up important ethical\nconcerns. A key issue is the risk of unfairly targeting men labeled as high-risk for \u2018pre-crime\u2019\nactions, which could lead to unintended consequences like stigmatisation. It is crucial to\nensure that using ML in this way does not violate individual rights or result in discrimination.\nAdditionally, follow-up monitoring for high-risk households needs to be handled with care.\nIntrusive actions could unintentionally harm women by causing suspicion or conflict at home.\nInstead, interventions should focus on supporting communities as a whole, creating an\natmosphere of support and awareness rather than surveillance.\nhttps://www.ideasforindia.in/topics/social-identity/harnessing-machine-learning-to-combat-domestic-violence-in-india.html 3/5\n23/05/2025, 16:43 Harnessing machine learning to combat domestic violence in India\nIt is crucial to create clear rules and protections to handle these ethical concerns. This\nincludes keeping data private, getting informed consent, and reducing bias in algorithms2. We\nshould also focus on community-based efforts, like education, support services, and economic\nprogrammes, to address the root causes of IPV.\nSumming up\nEven with progress, challenges still exist in predicting and addressing IPV because of\nunderreporting and the stigma victims face. Studies show that many victims stay silent out of\nfear of retaliation or being socially shunned, which keeps a culture of silence and impunity\nalive. The Covid-19 pandemic has made this worse, causing a global rise in domestic violence\ncases.\nML techniques should be seen as one part of a broader approach to tackling IPV. It is\nimportant to develop strategies that address systemic inequalities, challenge patriarchal\nnorms, and offer support services for victims. Prioritising ethical issues like data privacy and\nreducing algorithm bias is also key to ensuring these technologies benefit everyone.\nThe views expressed in this post are solely those of the authors, and do not necessarily reflect\nthose of the I4I Editorial Board.\nI4I is now on Substack.

Research suggests that younger adults, particularly those in their late teens to early 30s,\nare more likely to be involved in IPV as perpetrators \u2013 relative to older adults.\n2. In the context of ML models predicting IPV, algorithm bias refers to the systematic errors\nor inaccuracies that can occur when an ML model produces unfair outcomes, often\nreflecting or exacerbating existing societal biases. This bias can arise from several sources,\nincluding biased or unrepresentative training data, the choice of features used in the\nmodel, or the way the algorithm processes the data. For example, if the training data used\nto develop an ML model is skewed toward a specific demographic (such as more data from\ncertain age groups, genders, or socioeconomic backgrounds), the model may\ndisproportionately predict IPV risk for that demographic, potentially leading to unfair or\ninaccurate risk assessments for other groups. This can result in both false positives\n(incorrectly identifying someone as high-risk for IPV) and false negatives (failing to identify\nsomeone who is at risk), with significant ethical and practical consequences.\nFurther Reading\nAmusa, Lateef B, Annah V Bengesai AV and Hafiz TA Khan (2022), \u201cPredicting the\nVulnerability of Women to Intimate Partner Violence in South Africa: Evidence from Tree-\nhttps://www.ideasforindia.in/topics/social-identity/harnessing-machine-learning-to-combat-domestic-violence-in-india.html 4/5\n23/05/2025, 16:43 Harnessing machine learning to combat domestic violence in India\nbased Machine Learning Techniques\u201d, Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 37(7-8), NP5228-\nNP5245. 10.1177/0886260520960110.\nCapaldi, Deborah M, Naomi B Knoble, Joann Wu Shortt and Hyoun K Kim (2012), \u201cA\nSystematic Review of Risk Factors for Intimate Partner Violence\u201d, Partner Abuse, April,\n3(2):231-280. doi: 10.1891/1946-6560.3.2.231.

    "content": "PROTECTION OF WOMEN FROM DOMESTIC\nVIOLENCE ACT: A PROCEDURAL ASPECT\nPratibha Tiwari*\nWhenever a new law comes it becomes the duty of the court to\ninterpret it in such manner to promote the purpose and object of that Act.\nProtection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 came into effect\nfrom 26th October 2006. From coming into the effect of this Act, not only\nthe litigants and advocates, but the judges also have faced many procedural\nand legal challenges while deciding the matters filed under the Domestic\nViolence Act. However, the law which came to protect the women of our\ncountry has matured considerably through judicial pronouncements. In order\nto have a better understanding of the procedural aspect, an attempt is\nmade to analyze the relevant provisions of the Act in the light of judicial\npronouncements which set out the legal position.\nApplicability of The Act\nThe Act extends to the whole of India except the State of Jammu\nAnd Kashmir.1 The Andhra Pradesh High Court held that Indian courts\ncan exercise jurisdiction even if parties reside in a foreign country as long\nas some incidents of domestic violence take place in India.2\nRetrospective Effect of the Act\nThe Supreme Court in Lt. Col. V. D. Bhanot v. Savita Bhanot3\ndealt with the matter of retrospective operation of the Act. It was held\nthat the past conduct of the parties, even if prior to the Act coming into\neffect, were relevant for passing orders under Sections 18, 19 and 20 of\nthe Act.\n* Civil Judge (Senior Division), Haridwar\n1 Section 1(2) of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005\n2 A. Ashok Vardhan Reddy, (A-1), A. Jani Reddy, (A-2) and Smt. A.Vijayamma, (A-3) v.\nSmt. P. Savitha, D/o. Potula Krishna Reddy, Crl.P. No. 7063 of 2008, Decided On:\n29.02.2012, Andhra Pradesh High Court.\n3 Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No. 3916 of 2010, Decided On: 07.02.2012\nUttarakhand Judicial & Legal Review\nWho can file an application?\nAn aggrieved person or a Protection Officer or any other person\non behalf of the aggrieved person may present an application to the\nMagistrate4. Aggrieved person is defined under section 2(a) which says\nthat \u201caggrieved person\u201d means any woman who is, or has been, in a\ndomestic relationship with the respondent and who alleges to have been\nsubjected to any act of domestic violence by the respondent. The term\nwomen is not qualified with any condition, therefore, irrespective of age\nand marital status, an aggrieved woman may file application if she has\nlived in a domestic relationship in a shared household.\nAn aggrieved wife or female, living in a relationship in the nature\nof a marriage may also file a complaint against a relative of the husband\nor the male partner. The expression \u2018domestic relationship\u2019 includes not\nonly the relationship of marriage but also a relationship \u2018in the nature of\nmarriage\u2019. The question, therefore, arises as to what is the meaning of\nthe expression \u2018a relationship in the nature of marriage\u2019. Supreme Court\nhas said that \u2018relationship in the nature of marriage\u2019 is akin to a common\nlaw marriage. Common law marriages require that although not being\nformally married :-\n(a) The couple must hold themselves out to society as being akin to\nspouses.\n(b) They must be of legal age to marry.\n(c) They must be otherwise qualified to enter into a legal marriage,\nincluding being unmarried.\n(d) They must have voluntarily cohabited and held themselves out to the\nworld as being akin to spouses for a significant period of time.\nA \u2018relationship in the nature of marriage\u2019 under the 2005 Act\nmust also fulfill the above requirements, and in addition the parties must\nhave lived together in a \u2018shared household\u2019. Merely spending weekends\ntogether or a one night stand would not make it a \u2018domestic relationship\u20195.\nThe Act gives a very wide interpretation to the term \u2018Domestic\nrelationship\u2019 as to take it outside the confines of marital relationship, and\n4 Section 12 of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005\n5 D.Velusamy Vs D. Patchaiammal, 2010 AIR SCW 6731\n88\nProtection of Women from Domestic Violence Act : A Procedural Aspect\neven includes live-in-relationships in the nature of marriage. Therefore,\nwomen in live-in-relationships are also entitled to all the reliefs given under\nthe said Act.6\nIt must be noted that an application filed under section 12 is not a\ncomplaint, therefore, recording of statement under section 200 and 202\nCr.P.C. is not required7.\nHere the Act makes a distinction from section 198A Cr.P.C.8\nwhich authorizes only the relatives of the married women to file a complaint\nfor offense of cruelty. It authorizes any other person to present the\napplication even if that person is not a relative of the aggrieved. Thus, a\nneighbor, a friend or a social worker may also file an application before a\nmagistrate.\nSuch application can be filed either directly to the magistrate or\nthrough protection officer9 or service providers10. In an emergency, if a\nprotection officer or service provider receives reliable information through\ne-mail or phone or the like, he shall seek immediate assistance of the\npolice and prepare a domestic incident report and present the same to the\nmagistrate without any delay for passing appropriate orders11.\nEvery aggrieved person must file her application in Form II or as\nnearly as possible thereto12 for which she may take help of protection\nofficer. If aggrieved person is not able to file it in Form II, then she can\nalso file it by a simple application but such application must contain the\nrequired details which are mentioned in Form II, like, the details of\nrespondent, relationship with respondent, nature of violence, description of\nrelief etc.\n6 Chanmuniya vs. Virendra Kumar Singh Kushwaha and another, (2011) 1 SCC 141\n7 Ajay Kant vs. Alka Sharma 2008 CrLJ 264 (MP)\n8 \u201c198A.Prosecution of offences under section 498A of the Indian Penal Code. No Court\nshall take cognizance of an Offenc Punishable section 498A of the Indian Penal Code\nexcept upon a police report of facts which constitute such offence or Upon a complaint\nmade by the person aggrieved by the offence or by her father, mother, brother, sister\nor by her father\u2019s or mother\u2019s brother or sister or, with the leave of the Court, by any\nother person related to her by blood, marriage or adoption.\n9 Rule 4 & 5(1) of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Rules 2006\n10 Rule 5(2) of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Rules 2006\n11 Rule 9 of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Rules 2006\n12 Rule 6(1) of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Rules 2006\n89\nUttarakhand Judicial & Legal Review\nPlace of Filing the Application-\nAccording to section 27, an application may be filed in the court\nof Judicial Magistrate of the first class or the Metropolitan Magistrate, as\nthe case may be, within the local limits of which-\n(a) the person aggrieved permanently or temporarily resides or\ncarries on business or is employed; or\n(b) the respondent resides or carries on business or is employed;\nor\n(c) the cause of action has arisen.\nThus, an aggrieved person is given a convenient jurisdiction for\nhearing which may be the place of her permanent or temporary residence.\nAgainst Whom Application can be Filed -\nAn application shall be filed against the respondent. 'Respondent'\nhas been defined under section 2(q). It means any adult male person who\nis, or has been, in a domestic relationship with the aggrieved person and\nagainst whom the aggrieved person has sought any relief under this Act:\nProvided that an aggrieved wife or female living in a relationship in the\nnature of a marriage may also file a complaint against a relative of the\nhusband or the male partner.\nInitially, it was understood that an application can be filed only\nagainst a male respondent and a proceeding could not be continued against\na female but the Kerala High court13 and the Delhi High court14 have\nheld that an aggrieved wife or a female living in a relationship in the\nnature of marriage may also file a complaint against a relative of the\nhusband or the male partner. And it is finally settled by Supreme Court\nthat in proviso to section 2(q), relative of husband or male partner includes\nfemale also and a female relative of husband or male partner may also be\na respondent under the Act15. But, few females who may commit an act\n13 Vijayalekshmi Amma Vs. Bindu [2010(1) KLT 79] D.B.\n14 Varsha Kapoor vs UoI & Ors., WP (Crl.) No. 638 of 2010, decided on 3 June, 2010\nby Delhi High Court.\n15 Sandhya Manoj Wankhade vs. Manoj Bhimrao Wankhade and others, (2011) 3 SCC\n650\n90\nProtection of Women from Domestic Violence Act : A Procedural Aspect\nof domestic violence are still not covered. For example, an aggrieved\nwomen cannot file application against her step-mother or maternal or\npaternal aunt.\nIt is necessary to have a clear understanding of domestic\nrelationship. \u201cDomestic relationship\u201d means a relationship between two\npersons who live or have, at any point of time, lived together in a shared\nhousehold, when they are related by consanguinity, marriage, or through a\nrelationship in the nature of marriage, adoption or are family members\nliving together as a joint family16. Thus, a person who is not in a domestic\nrelationship, cannot be a respondent under this Act.\nDate of First Hearing and Mode of Service on Respondent\nThe Magistrate shall fix the first date of hearing, which shall not\nordinarily be beyond three days from the date of receipt of the application\nby the court17. A notice of the date of hearing shall be given by the\nMagistrate to the Protection Officer, who shall get it served on the\nrespondent, and on any other person, as directed by the Magistrate within\na maximum period of two days or such further reasonable time as may be\nallowed by the Magistrate from the date of its receipt.\nThe rules provides for alternate modes of service. The notices\nshall be served by the Protection Officer or any other person directed by\nhim to serve the notice, on behalf of the Protection Officer, at the address\nwhere the respondent is stated to be ordinarily residing in India by the\ncomplainant or aggrieved person or where the respondent is stated to be\ngainfully employed by the complainant or aggrieved person, as the case\nmay be18. A declaration of service of notice made by the Protection Officer\nshall be the proof that such notice was served upon the respondent and\non any other person as directed by the Magistrate unless the contrary is\nproved19.\nFor serving the notices, the provisions under Order V of the\nCivil Procedure Code, 1908 or the provisions under Chapter VI of the\n16 Section 2(f) of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005\n17 Section 12(4) of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005\n18 Rule 12(2)(a) of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Rules 2006\n19 Section 13 of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005\n91\nUttarakhand Judicial & Legal Review\nCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973 as far as practicable may also be\nadopted20. Service of notice may be made by post or by a police officer\nas the circumstances requires. Since the time of two days is very short,\nso the protection officer may serve the notice by fax, phone or email but\nhe has to make a declaration regarding service of notice.\nNature of Hearing-\nSection 28 says that Save as otherwise provided in this Act, all\nproceedings under sections 12, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 shall be governed\nby the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and court may\nlay down its own procedure for disposal of an application under section\n12 or under sub-section (2) of section 23. Rule 6(5) says that the\napplications under section 12 shall be dealt with and the orders enforced\nin the same manner laid down under section 125 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure, 1973.\nSupreme Court in the matter of Vijay Kumar Prasad versus\nState of Bihar and others, has held that proceedings under Section 125\nof Cr.P.C. are of civil nature21. A proceeding under Section 125 Cr.P.C. is\nquasi civil and quasi criminal. In so far as it decides the civil rights of the\nparties to claim maintenance, it is civil in nature. When the order is not\nobeyed by the person against whom the same has been made, then the\ncourt is empowered to impose a punishment of imprisonment of one month\nfor each breach. To that extent, the proceeding is criminal22.\nThe Division Bench of the Kerala High Court stated that on an\napplication filed under section 12 claiming reliefs either under section 18,\n19, 20, 21 or 22, the Magistrate can pass an interim order under section\n18 to 23 and all these reliefs are in respect of the civil liability and not the\ncriminal liability23. So, an application under section 12 has to be disposed\noff in civil manner.\n20 Rule 12(2)(c) of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Rules 2006\n21 2004(2) RCR (Criminal) 470 S.C.\n22 P. Vaithi vs Kanagavalli, Criminal Revision Case No.1237 of 2009 and M.P. No.1 of\n2009, Madras High Court decided on 2 February, 2010\n23 Vijayalekshmi Amma Vs. Bindu [2010(1) KLT 79] D.B.\n92\nProtection of Women from Domestic Violence Act : A Procedural Aspect\nThe Kerala High Court24, Bombay High Court25, Madhya Pradesh\nHigh court26, Allahabad High Court27 and Delhi High Court28 have held\nthat proceedings under the Act cannot be quashed under section 482 Cr.\nP.C. The higher courts are of the view that proceedings under the said\nAct are civil in nature and a person may approach the higher court by\nfiling an appeal as provided under the Act, therefore, such a proceeding\ncannot be quashed under section 482 Cr.P.C. However, in Inderjit Singh\nGrewal Vs. State Of Punjab And Anr29, the Supreme Court quashed the\nproceedings under the Act while dealing with them under section 482 Cr.\nP.C. But, the Apex Court has not touched the procedural aspect of the\nAct as discussed by the High Courts.\nProcedure after appearance or non-appearance of Respondent\nA person to whom notice was issued by the Magistrate in a petition\nfiled under section 12 of the Act can appear before the Magistrate and\ncontend that the proceedings is not maintainable either on the ground that\nthe person who filed the application is not an aggrieved person as defined\nunder section 2(a) or the application is not filed for an aggrieved person.\nHe is also entitled to contend that he is not a respondent, as defined under\nsection 2(q) of the Act. He is also entitled to contend that there is no\ndomestic violence as defined under section 2(g) or the reliefs sought for\nare not the reliefs provided under the Act. So long as the respondent is\nnot an accused in a proceeding initiated under the Act and pending before\nthe Magistrate, he is not obliged to apply for bail in respect of such\nproceedings and even his personal presence is not mandatory for hearing30.\nThe magistrate may after giving an opportunity of hearing to\naggrieved person and the respondent and on being prima facie satisfied\nthat domestic violence has taken place or is likely to take place, pass any\norder under sections 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23. He may at any stage,\n24 Ibid.\n25 Mangesh Sawant vs. Minal Vijay Bhosale and Anr, Criminal Writ Petition No. 905/\n2010, decided on 05-10-2011\n26 Ajay Kant vs. Alka Sharma 2008 CrLJ 264 MP\n27 Vinod Parashar vs. State of U.P. 2008 CrLJ (NOC) 837 All\n28 Maya Devi vs. State of NCT of Delhi, MANU/DE/8716/2007\n29 (2011) 12 SCC 588\n30 Infra note 23\n93\nUttarakhand Judicial & Legal Review\ndirect for a counseling or take assistance of welfare expert31. Since, the\nproceedings are civil in nature and if respondent does not appear, the\ncourt may proceed exparte and pass appropriate interim or exparte orders\nunder section 23.\nWhat Orders That May Be Passed\nA magistrate may pass protection order32, residence order33,\nmonetary reliefs34, custody orders35 and compensation orders36. The\nmagistrate may also pass interim and exparte orders in the nature of\nprotection order, residence order, monetary reliefs, custody orders and\ncompensation orders.\nProtection Order: A protection order may be passed to prohibit the\nrespondent from committing the domestic violence and to prevent from\naiding or abetting the commission of acts of domestic violence against\naggrieved person or the dependents, or other relatives or any person giving\nassistance to aggrieved person. Respondent may also be restrained from\nentering into the place of employment of aggrieved, or school of aggrieved\nor any other place of frequent visit. He may be prevented from\ncommunicating to the aggrieved in any manner. The respondent cannot\ndispose of any joint asset or stridhan.\nResidence Order: By passing the residence order, a magistrate may\nrestrain the respondent from dispossessing or disturbing the possession of\naggrieved person from the shared household and that may be ordered\neven if she has no legal or equitable interest. To protect the aggrieved, the\nrespondent may be directed to remove himself from the shared household;\nrestrained from entering into any portion of shared household; restrained\nfrom renouncing his rights in the shared household or to secure same\nlevel of alternate accommodation for the aggrieved or to pay the rent for\nthe same. However, a female cannot be directed to be removed from the\nshared household. Magistrate may require the respondent to execute a\n31 Section 14 & 15 of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005\n32 Section 18 of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005\n33 Section 19 of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005\n34 Section 20 of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005\n35 Section 21 of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005\n36 Section 22 of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005\n94\nProtection of Women from Domestic Violence Act : A Procedural Aspect\nbond or may impose additional conditions to prevent the domestic violence.\nMagistrate may also direct the respondent to return the stridhan or other\nproperty or valuable security to which she is entitled to.\nThe Act recognizes the right to reside in a shared household and\nprovides that an aggrieved person shall not be evicted or excluded from\nthe shared household or any part of it except with the procedure established\nby law.37 Madras High Court in V. Ramasubramanian J. in Vandhana v.\nT. Srikanth and Krishnamachari38 opined that a \u201chealthy and correct\ninterpretation of Sections 2(f) and 2(s) would be that the words \u201clive\u201d or\n\u201chave at any point of time lived\u201d would include within their purview the\n\u201cright to live\u201d. The judgment clarified that the woman\u2019s right to protection\nunder Section 17 of the Act, co-exists with her right to live in the Shared\nHousehold and is not dependent on whether or not she had marked her\nphysical presence in the Shared Household. However, this right has been\nrestricted by the judgment of Supreme Court in S.R. Batra vs. Smt. Tarun\nBatra.39 The apex court held that \u2018shared household\u2019 means only the\nhouse belonging to or taken on rent by the husband or house which belongs\nto the joint family in which the husband is one of the members. It has also\nbeen observed therein that the property exclusively owned by the mother\nof the husband cannot be called \u2018shared household\u2019, as per the definition\nfound in Section 2(s) of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence\nAct, 2005. Therefore, she cannot claim a right to residence in that property.\nThe impact of this judgment is that an aggrieved woman cannot claim a\nright of residence in the property of her in-laws. This will have a negative\nimpact on those aggrieved persons who are widow because in light of the\nBatra\u2019s judgment a women can claim the right of residence only in the\nhouse belonging to or taken on rent by the husband or house which belongs\nto the joint family in which the husband is one of the members. So an\naggrieved widow living in the house of the relative of her deceased husband\ncannot get the protection.\nMonetary Relief: The magistrate may direct the respondent to pay\nmonetary relief to meet the expenses incurred and losses suffered by the\naggrieved and any child of the aggrieved which may include loss of earnings;\n37 Section 17 of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005\n38 MANU/TN/7835/2007\n39 (2007) 8 SCC 2675\n95\nUttarakhand Judicial & Legal Review\nmedical expenses; expenses for destruction, damage or removal of any\nproperty of aggrieved and maintenance. The monetary relief shall be\nadequate, fair and reasonable and consistent with the standard of living to\nwhich the aggrieved is accustomed.\nCustody Order: At any stage of hearing, magistrate may grant temporary\ncustody of any child or children to the aggrieved and make the\narrangements for visit of such child or children by the respondent.\nCompensation Order: In addition to the other reliefs, the magistrate\nmay also order to pay compensation and damages for the injuries, including\nmental torture and emotional distress, caused by the acts of domestic\nviolence.\nImportance of Domestic Incident Report\nUpon receiving the complaint, the protection officer is under duty\nto make a domestic incident report to the magistrate40. A protection officer\nis under supervision and control of magistrate, therefore, the magistrate\nmay also call for any such report41. Service provider shall have power to\nrecord the domestic incident report if the aggrieved person so desires and\nforward the copy to the magistrate and protection officer42. However, this\nreport is not mandatory for the filling of applications. It is not mandatory\nfor the court to wait for the said report before issuing notice. The report\nis also not mandatory for passing an order. However, if the report has\nalready been submitted, that should be considered, in view of the proviso\nto section 12(1)43.\nOther Relief/Remedy not Barred\nAny relief available under sections 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 may\nalso be sought in any legal proceeding, before a civil court, family court or\na criminal court44. However, section 26(3) creates a positive obligation on\nthe woman to disclose any reliefs obtained under another law to the\nMagistrate.\n40 Section 9(1)(b) of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005\n41 Section 9(2) of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005\n42 Section 10(2) of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005\n43 Bhupendra Singh Mehra & Anr. vs. State of NCT of Delhi & Anr. 2010 (4) JCC 2939\nDelhi High Court, D.B.\n44 Section 26 of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005\n96\nProtection of Women from Domestic Violence Act : A Procedural Aspect\nBreach of Protection Order\nA breach of protection order, or of an interim protection order, by\nthe respondent shall be an offence under this Act and shall be punishable\nwith imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to\none year, or with fine which may extend to twenty thousand rupees, or\nwith both45. Whenever a respondent commits a breach of any protection\norder under this Act, he commits an offence which is cognizable and non-\nbailable46. A maintenance order including interim maintenance order passed\nunder section 23, cannot be enforced through section 3147 and it can be\nenforced in the same manner as laid down under section 125 Cr. P.C.48\nSection 20(4) provides the mechanism for compliance with the maintenance\norder.\nThe language of section 31 has used the term \u2018breach of protection\norder\u2019, so it appears that it is only the breach of section 18 which constitutes\nthe offence because \u2018protection order\u2019 has been described in section 18.\nHowever, rule 15(7) says that any resistance to the enforcement of the\norders of the Court under the Act by the respondent or any other person\npurportedly acting on his behalf shall be deemed to be a breach of protection\norder or an interim protection order covered under the Act. The language\nof this rule suggests that breach of any other order like residence order,\ncustody order etc. shall also be an offence as defined under section 31. It\nwould be of very restrictive meaning if operation of section 31 is accepted\nto cover only the protection order as mentioned in section 18. Under section\n18 a magistrate may pass a protection in order to restrain the respondent\nfrom committing any act of domestic violence. Definition of domestic\nviolence under section 3 of the Act is very wide in the sense that it covers\nany act, omission or commission or conduct which harms or injures or\nendangers the health or safety, life, limb or well being, whether mental or\nphysical of aggrieved. An act of dispossession from the shared household\nmay lead to endanger the safety, life, limb or well being of aggrieved\nperson who is a woman. Residence orders are passed to protect the\n45 Section 31 of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005\n46 Section 32 of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005\n47 Manoj Anand vs. State of U.P., Criminal Revision No. 635/2011 with Writ Petition\nNo. 17658 of 2010, decided on 10-02-10\n48 Rule 6(5) of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Rules 2006\n97\nUttarakhand Judicial & Legal Review\naggrieved from the dispossession, therefore, a breach of residence order\ncould also be an offence under section 31. With force of rule 15(7), it\nwould be safe to say that except the breach of maintenance order, breach\nof any other order should also be an offence under section 31.\nThe offence shall as far as possible be tried by the magistrate\nwho had passed the order and while framing charges under section 31,\nthe magistrate may also frame charges under section 498-A of IPC or\nany other provision of that Code or the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, as\nthe case may be, if the facts disclose the commission of an offence under\nthose provisions.\nThe proceeding under this section shall be governed by the\nprovisions of Criminal Procedure Code.49 But an offence under section\n31 shall be tried summarily and if any other offence under any other law\nis not summarily triable, the magistrate may separate the proceedings as\nprescribed in Criminal Procedure Code.50\nAn aggrieved person may in writing, report the breach of the\nprotection order or an interim protection order to the protection officer\nwho shall forward it to the Magistrate. She may also directly approach to\nthe Magistrate. A breach of protection order or an interim protection order\nshall be reported to the local police station which shall be treated as\ncognizable. Court may, while enlarging the person on bail, impose the\nconditions to protect the aggrieved person.51\nPenalty for not Discharging Duty by Protection Officer\nUnder section 33, if any Protection Officer fails or refuses to\ndischarge his duties as directed by the Magistrate in the protection order\nwithout any sufficient cause, he shall be punished with imprisonment of\neither description for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine\nwhich may extend to twenty thousand rupees, or with both. Though a\nprotection officer is under supervision and control of the Magistrate52 but\na protection officer is a public servant within the meaning of section 21 of\n49 Section 28 of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005\n50 Rule 15(6) of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Rules 2006\n51 Rule 15 of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Rules 2006\n52 Section 9(2) of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005\n98\nProtection of Women from Domestic Violence Act : A Procedural Aspect\nIPC.53 Therefore, no prosecution or other legal proceeding shall lie against\nthe Protection Officer unless a complaint is filed with the previous sanction\nof the State Government or an officer authorized by it in this behalf.54\nUnlike section 32 which makes the offence under section 31 cognizable\nand non-bailable, the Act is silent regarding section 33, therefore, the\nprovisions of Cr. P.C. will come in picture and as per the schedule of Cr.\nP.C. The offence under section 33 shall be non-cognizable and bailable.\nConclusion\nThe Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 is\nenacted with a noble intention to provide effective protection of the rights\nof women guaranteed under the Constitution who are victims of violence\nof any kind occurring within the family but protection of one must not\nresult in harassment of other, therefore, while protecting the rights of\naggrieved person courts has to make a balance between the conflicting\ninterests. Courts have to address the areas which are still untouched and\nissues can be settled only by a positive approach so that we the people of\nIndia strive towards excellence.\n*********\n53 Section 30 of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005\n54 Section 34 of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005\n99"

1\nINTRODUCTION\nThese days, the very mention of Khap Panchayats brings to mind horrifying images of\nmurdered couples who married for love or of women being gang raped for falling in love outside\nthe community. In Haryana and Western UP this body is an institution which refuses to embrace\nmodernity. The all powerful Khap Panchayats consisting of village elder\u2019s form on the line of caste\nor community are motivated by the need to perpetuate a feudal and patriarchal order. In Haryana\nand Rajasthan, Khaps usually consists of upper caste people (Hodas, Sheorans, Ruhals, Punias, and\nSangwans, Maliks) with larger lands as well as muscle power. These self styled guardians of the\nrest of the members of the village or concerned society impart justice at their will. They issue\ndiktats to ostracize families, declare marriages as void, declare husband and wife as brothers and\nsisters and give different other discriminative and derogatory orders. In their system a girl falling in\nlove with a boy from the same gotra is the worst crime possible and is to be translated into\nimmediate wilful punishment, such as the guilty can be expelled from the village made to drink\nurine, paraded naked, beaten up or killed. Their families are also boycotted and some time made to\npaid heavy fines.\nNow days even the lower castes have started their own Khaps. Khap is and old system of\nsocial administration followed mainly in the north-western states of Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar\nPradesh. These are extra constitutional, extra judicial bodies that began as clannish organizations in\nthe tribal era but have literally transformed into kangaroo courts. In Haryana\u2019s villages, they run a\nlargely retrogressive and parallel law enforcement bodies. Khap Panchayats are not to be confused\nfor elected gram Panchayats, but the kind of support Khaps enjoy in villages as well as in urban\nareas with little or no oppositions, it isn\u2019t surprising that they have become more powerful than the\nelected gram Panchayats as one unit of khap takes care of the social affairs of almost 84 villages\nfrom the same caste.\nAlthough recently with the news of Satrol Khap allowing Inter-caste marriages between the\nfamilies within a radius of 42 villages has arisen some hope for human rights in the khap land.\n1\nInter-caste marriages have been a major reason for so called \u201chonour killings\u201d in the recent past.\nHowever, marriages within same village and same gotra are still barred.1 Khap panchayats are\ncollective patriarchal bodies which function as extrajudicial bodies and hold political influence in\nthe area. They are highly patriarchal in nature and mobilize a large number of people on the basis of\nfamily, gotra, community and villages. Accepting the predominantly chauvinistic nature of the self\nstyled courts,\u201d Justice Verma Committee report denied the khaps having any sanction under law.2\nThe people affected by khaps i.e, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh (West) defend khap as being a part of\ntheir tradition and age old culture. Khap is a way of honouring their culture and the values their\nancestors taught.\nKhap Panchayats are mostly quasi judicial & political in nature and are generally being used\nas a tool to consolidate the power in region. It is because of their powerful political stronghold that\nthey overrule, with impunity, the constitutionally mandated administration of equality in favour of\nwomen, by using extra constitutional, oppressive methods of punishment.3 Khap Panchayats are\nbeing used as launching pads by politicians as being an active member one get wider acceptability\nand exposure required for entering mainstream politics.\nCaste system in its inherent patriarchal nature influences the ways of living and believing,\ngiving power to units like Khap Panchayats. The Indian Society which is highly patriarchal in\nnature believes in a way of living which is very rigid and based on certain norms. These norms\ninclude the caste system which is prevalent all over the country. Along with the caste system comes\nthe concept of Gotra. \u2018Gotra\u2019 is a lineage that is associated to an individual at his/her birth. The\nfather\u2019s gotra is carried forward by the child following the norms of a patriarchal society i.e. to\npeople belonging to the same gotra are not permitted to marry since they are considered to be as\nbrother and sister. Same gotra marriages are a sensitive issue and have helped the Khaps to gather\nmass public support. However, in today\u2019s time where the norms of the society are constantly\nchanging, there is conflict between the ancient practices and the modern liberal opinion of the\nyouth. This conflict further result into certain type of punishments to the revolting youth, in the\n1 Manveer Saini, \u201cKhap Panchayat okays Marriages between Castes,\u201d The Times of India, dated April 21,\n2014.\n2See report of the JS Verma Committee Report available at\nhttp://www.prsindia.org/uploads/media/Justice%20verma%20committee/js%20verma%20committe%20report.\npdf\n3 See ibid.\n2\nname of restoring ancient customs and practices, and to set an example for others in the village. On\nmany occasion the young boys and girls are killed in the name of the honour of the family and\ncommunity. Such incidents are generally not reported and the culprits move freely and carry on.\nApart from same gotra marriage, other issues which are dealt by Khap Panchayat are inter-caste and\ninter-religious matter.\n\u2018Honour killings\u2019 or killing in the name of supposed \u2018honour,\u2019 seeped in the cancer of\npatriarchy is not only a phenomenon restricted to India but witnessed worldwide. Honour is a social\nconcept and its meaning varies from society to society. In a modern day, individualistic society, the\nterm honour is synonymous with integrity, a person\u2019s individual actions. However in communal\ncultures honour are collective terms referring not simply to the social behaviour of one person, but\nof the collective behaviour of a family. Women, it seems epitomise \u2018honour\u2019 across societies. In the\nApril of 1999, Samia Sarwar was shot and killed in her attorney\u2019s office in Pakistan as she was\nfiling for divorce from her abusive husband. The murder was perpetrated by her own parents, who\nfelt that she had tarnished their honour by seeking a divorce, even though they knew that her\nhusband had violently abused her throughout their marriage.4 Despite the number of witnesses,\ndespite the pressure brought by women\u2019s groups very little action has been taken against the family\nor the perpetrators.5\n\u201cHonour is generally seen as residing in the bodies of women. Frameworks of \u2018honour\u2019, and its\ncorollary \u2018shame\u2019, operate to control, direct and regulate women\u2019s sexuality and freedom of\nmovement by male members of the family. Women who fall in love, engage in extramarital\nrelationships, seek a divorce, choose their own husbands are seen to transgress the boundaries of\nappropriate\u2019\u2019 (that is, socially sanctioned) sexual behaviour. \u2018Regulation\u2019 of such behaviour may in\nextreme cases involve horrific direct violence \u2013 including \u2018honour\u2019 killing\u2026 in these contexts, the\nrights of women (and girls) to control their own lives, to liberty and freedom of expression,\nassociation, movement and body integrity mean very little.6\n4 Yolanda Asamoah-Wade, \u201cWomen\u2019s Human Rights and \u2018Honour Killings\u2019 in Islamic Cultures, 8 Buff.\nWomen\u2019s L.J. 21 (1999).\n5 Radhika Coomaraswamy, \u201cIntegration of The Human Rights of Women and The Gender Perspective Violence\nAgainst Women\u201d Report of The Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women, Its Causes and\nConsequences, Submitted in Accordance With Commission On Human Rights Resolution 2001/49 Cultural\nPractices In The Family That Are Violent Towards Women, E/CN.4/2002/83, Dated January 31, 2002.\n6 According to the former United Nation Rapporteur on Violence against Women.\n3\nA Khap mahapanchayat was held at Garhmukteshwar, 60 km from Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh to\ndiscuss the same gotra marriages. In this meeting the Bharitya Kisan Union leaders were present.\nThey decided that such marriages will not be tolerated at any cost and the couples will be separated\nforcefully if they get married against their diktat. The khap Panchayat also demanded an\namendment in Hindu Marriage Act, 1956, disallowing marriages between same gotra. As of now,\nby virtue of section 29 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1956, sagotra marriages are recognised in law as\nbeing valid.\nOn May 14, 2010 a Khap Panchayat had issued death threat to a couple, who later married\nagainst their diktat. The Panchayat had barred Jaivinder, a resident of Chithera village, from\nmarrying Manisha of Bisnoli Village, claiming their marriage will be against local societal norms.\nAlthough the boy and the girl belonged to different gotra, the Panchayat ruled that as residents of\nChithera consider girls belonging to Bhatti gotra as their sisters, Jaivinder could not marry Manisha\nwho belongs to the Bhatti sub caste, Jaivinder belongs to Banisha gotra. The Panchayat had\nthreatened to kill them if they went ahead with the marriage. On two occasions in the recent past,\nthe Panchayat had forcibly cancelled the marriage of local boys with Bhatti girls\nNawal, a twenty-four-year-old Palestinian woman, was accused by her family of behaving\ndishonourably because people in their village were gossiping about her. Fearing for her safety, she\nasked for police protection, and the police consequently made her brothers sign a pledge not to hurt\nher. Only three out of the four brothers signed the pledge. The fourth killed her by beating her\nrepeatedly and then strangling her with a plastic wire around her neck.7\nWhen Amal, a seventeen-year-old Jordanian girl, informed her family that she had been raped\nand impregnated by her father\u2019s friend, the family immediately tried to raise money for an abortion\nin an effort to avoid the stigma that would attach as a result of a premarital pregnancy. After a\ndoctor refused to perform the abortion, Amal\u2019s father took the money, bought a shotgun, and, along\nwith Amal's brother, shot Amal eight times in an attempt to kill her.8\n7 Nadera Shalhoub-Kevorkian, \u201cFemicide and the Palestinian Criminal Justice System: Seeds of Change in the\nContext of State Building?.\u201d 36 Law & Soc'y Rev. 577, 589 (2002).\n8 Kathryn Christine Arnold, Comment, \u201cAre the Perpetrators of Honour Crimes Getting Away with Murder?:\nArticle 340 of the Jordanian Penal Code Analyzed Under the Convention of the Elimination of All Forms of\nDiscrimination Against Women,\u201d 16 Am.

The National Commission for Women took a suo moto\ncognizance of the incident and constituted an Inquiry committee into the matter vide order dated\n11.06.2012.\nOn June 15, 2012, a girl studying in a Bulandshehar college was allegedly cremated by her\nfamily in Bhaipur-Brahampur village, Greater Noida. The Police suspected it was a case of honour\nkilling. Since no FIR was lodged nor a complaint was registered in the case, NCW took suo moto\ncognizance of the incident to inquire into the matter. In its recommendations, the inquiry\ncommittee, headed by NCW member Charu Wali Khanna, said, \"The usage of the word (honour)\nhas a tendency to rationalize and legitimize the motive of the crime by creating a false notion that\nthe crime has been committed to save the 'honour' of the family. Thus implying society is bound by\ntradition to protect this violation of tradition.\"\nIn Kolar village, tehsil Sarada of Udaipur, a married woman, who had eloped with a 28 year\nold man was found sitting at a bus stand in the neighbourhood along with the man. On information,\nthe villagers forcibly took them back to the village and tied them to trees. The woman was stripped\nin full view of the village and both were severely beaten. The Panchayat\u2019s men snipped their hair as\nwell. The NCW took suo moto cognizance of the incident to inquire into the matter and set up an\ninquiry committee. The committee visited the place and met the victim and gave certain\nrecommendations to the Chief Secretary, Govt of Rajasthan on 17.08.2012.\n18-year-old Nidhi, was killed in cold blood along with her lover by her father who showed\nno remorse on killing her daughter for \u201chonour\u201d since their affair had insulted the family in the\n9Nupur Basu, \u201cHonour killings: India's crying shame,\u201d available at\nhttp://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/11/honour-killings-india-crying-shame-\n20131127105910392176.html.\n5\nsociety. The NCW again took suo moto cognizance of the incident to inquire into the matter and set\nup an inquiry committee vide order 27.11.2013. The committee visited Gharnavati village and sent\nits recommendations to the Chief Secretary, Govt of Haryana.\nA twenty year old tribal woman has been gang-raped and brutalized at the order of a\nShalishi Sabha, a community body in Birbhum, West Bengal. The offence committed by her was\ninappropriate romantic relationship (an affair with a man of different community). The residents of\nthe village where the incident occurred are petrified and most of the villagers are refused to talk\nabout the incident and few who spoke said that they did not know about the gang-rape. All they told\nis that all they know is the boy and girl was found in an objectionable situation and according to\nvillage rules they were tied to a tree for the entire night and were tried in a Shalishi Sabha\n(Kangaroo Court). Each of them was asked to pay a fine of Rs. 25,000. The Kangaroo Court\nreleased the boy after his family paid the fine while when the group of villagers went to girl\u2019s house\nto collect the fine but her family expressed inability to pay up. It was then that the girl was picked\nup and was gang-raped.10 NCW took suo moto cognizance of the incident to inquire into the matter.\nThe commission sought an ATR from DGP West Bengal vide letter dated 23.01.2014 and also\nconstituted an inquiry into the matter under the National Commission for Women Act, 1990 vide\norder dated 28.01.2014.\nThe Birbhum incident mirrors the awful decrees of the Khap Panchayat in Haryana and Western\nUttar Pradesh, which punishes any transgression of caste purities through extreme social\nintimidation to the extent of murder. These cases remind us the merging of difference between\nstructured grass root governance (Panchayati Raj Institutions) and the sway of an atavistic\ncommunity body (Khap Panchayat).11 This incident is a sobering warning to all those who speak in\nterms of benefits of community justice or believe that the people should decide on matters of crime\nand punishment or other social issues.\nMost of the societies are often liberal and their impulses are checked by civic democratic\ninstitutions and the rule of law. The will of the people filters through the structures of the decision\nmaking where diverse groups elect leaders who must weigh and balance competing interests within\n10 Statesmen News Service, Bengal SP Shunted in Birbhum Gang-rape Case, Kolkata, January 23, 2014.\n11 Press Monitor, We, the Mob: The Birbhum Gang-rape Case Illustrates The Oppression Of \u2018Community\nJustice\u2019, Indian Express, January 24, 2014\n6\nthe framework of law. Direct democracy which relies on popular referendum has been demonstrated\nto hurt minority interests the most.\nThe Birbhum incident has led to outrage in India which some people describing it as inhuman\nand completely outrageous and calling for quick trial and punishment of the rapists. All the 13\naccused were arrested and sent to judicial custody immediately. The accused include the Adivasi\nvillage\u2019s headman, Balai Maddi, who took the lead in brutalizing the twenty year old girl. In this\ncase the role of the police has also come under scanner as it failed to seek custody of the accused in\nsuch a major plan. The public prosecutor also did not appear in the court.\nThe incident was described as highly condemnable and shocking as Adivasi communities had a\nculture of gender equality and they too have been succumbed to retrograde practices of so called\nHonour Killing. It is being observed that in West Bengal in several districts there is growing\natmosphere of violence with gangs of armed anti-socials taking the law in their own hands. This is\nbecause many of them enjoy the political patronage resulting in the administration turning a blind\neye to them.\nOn the face of it, the existence of Khap Panchayat, Kangaroo Courts and Shalishi Adalat/Sabha\nis unconstitutional and it is strange that they are still functioning in our country. In a democratic\ncountry which is based on rule of law no vigilantism can be permitted and the strictest punishment\nshould be given to the culprit of such incidents.\n\u2018Honour\u2019 killings, commonplace in the states Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and a\nfew pockets of Delhi, draw blood as also a sense of legitimacy from the very society these\ndishonorable doings thrive in, with the support of a powerful force that works behind the scenes and\nwithin it. These undisputed torchbearers of traditions and morality are the khaps, kangaroo courts\nand shaileshi adalats instructing and ensuring the social fabric remains untouched by \u2018defiled\u2019\ninfluences of modernity.12\n12 Gitanjali Gayatri, \u201cTill \u2018honour\u2019 do them part,\u201d report dated 30 September 2013, National Legal Research\nDesk \u2013 A Shakti Vahini Initiative, available at http://honourcrimes.wordpress.com/2013/09/30/till-honour-do-\nthem-part/.\n7\nCertain sections of Indian society especially the NGO\u2019s13 along with the media have for\nsome time been demanding that these Panchayats, modern-day avatars of traditional social\nassemblies in rural north-western India that were primarily engaged in resolving disputes and\nensuring adherence to custom, be restrained. Khap Panchayats are self styled setups that have\ngained notoriety for resorting to honour killings of young couples or social boycott of their families\nfor a simple reason that they chose to marry by choice.\nThe role of Khaps is not restricted to limiting a woman\u2019s right to choose her partner for\nmatrimonial purpose manifesting itself either my means of honour killings or forced marriages but\nalso extends to putting restraints on her personal liberty. Be it the way she is allowed to dress, what\nkind of clothes she is allowed or not allowed to wear and her right to move within the geographical\narea.\nRight to freedom of life and liberty are the basic fundamental rights enshrined in our\nconstitution. Rarely has anyone spoken against the Khaps in spite of their brutal misdeeds let alone\nanyone coming forward to register a case against them. Justice Verma committee14 had slammed\nkhap Panchayats and their influence on honour killings and called them as extra-constitutional\nbodies that restrain the right of men and women to select a partner of their choice, and have no\nsanction of law in India.15\nAlong with Khap Panchayats have equally been notorious the Kangaroo Courts and the\nShalishi Adalats. Kangaroo Court is an unofficial court held by a group of people in order to try\nsomeone regarded, especially without good evidence, as guilty of a crime or misdemeanor.\" A\n\u201cKangaroo Court is a mock-court set up to deliver a judgment arrived at in advance, the\nmotivation being to punish a disloyal cohort. The kangaroo court is illegal and lack legitimacy.\nThere are no norms of justice or judicial procedure which are observed and in it, as a rule, the\n13 Special mention to be made of the NGO Shakti Vahini that filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court of India\nbringing to the notice of the court the parallel courts being run by khaps as extra-constitutional bodies.\n14 A three member committee headed by Justice JS Verma was constituted by GOI Notification no.

The trial of hostage by the terrorist\nis one such example.\u201d16 The Supreme court many times raised the issue that illegal Khap\nPanchayat that encourages honour killing and the discriminative and derogatory practices against\nwomen should be stamped out. Despite penal laws against sexual violence and harassment has\nbeen strengthened significantly, it is strange that the entire village including women, backed the\nkangaroo court and the culprits got away with fine however the girl was raped for not having\nmeans to pay fine. The Birbhum incidence prove that stringent laws , procedure and security\nmeasures are not enough, it is social attitude which require to change reflecting liberal and human\nvalues for gender equality and protection of women. Our rural and interior India is outside the pale\nof country\u2019s constitutional values and judicial system.\nShalishi, a Bengali word of Persian origin, means mediation or arbitration. But what actually\nhappens at these Kangaroo courts is a mockery of mediation. Though they are supposed to handle\nand resolve only petty civil disputes, these adalats pass judgement, and more often than not very\nflawed and biased ones, on a range of crimes ranging from thefts and extra-marital affairs to rape.\nIn most rape cases, the accused, especially if they come from relatively affluent or influential\nfamilies, get away with just small fines. These courts are whimsical in dishing out sentences.\nAdultery, for instance, could attract anything from a death sentence to a fine of a few thousand\nrupees, while a petty thief could expect to be fined, flogged in public or even banished from the\nvillage. \"It all depends on the financial and social status of the accused, the mood of the elders of\nthe village who are members of the Shalishi court and their relationship with the accused or his or\nher family. In 2004, the Left Front government attempted to give a legal sanction to \u2018Shalishi\nadalats\u2019 through the West Bengal Block Level Pre-Litigation Conciliation Board Bill (which came\nto be better known as the Shalishi Bill). Under this Bill, \u2018Conciliation Boards\u2019 were to be set up in\nevery administrative block for adjudication of minor disputes. But the opposition Congress and\nTrinamool Congress cried foul and launched a series of agitations against the bill, and the\ngovernment was ultimately forced to abandon its plans to introduce the Bill in the state assembly.\nThe opposition parties\u2019 contention was that the Left (primarily the CPM) would appoint only their\nown party men to the \u2018Conciliation Boards\u2019 and the Marxists would thus strengthen their grip on\npower in the rural areas. Nonetheless, the \u2018Shalishi adalats\u2019 thrive and disburse \u201cinjustice\u201d at\n16 Vikram Singh, (2012) \u201cPublic Administration Dictionary,\" TMH, New Delhi.\n9\nlightning speed, the Birbhum Gang rape case highlighting the worst of the \u201cinjustice\u201d a shalishi\nAdalats can give.17\nDeath sentences imposed by \u2018Shalishi adalats\u2019 are usually executed in utmost secrecy, and the\nwhole village takes an \u2018omerta\u2019 or oath of silence, foiling any effort of Police to arrest any one of\nthem.\n1.1 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\na. To find out why discriminatory and derogatory practices like honour kill are still\nprevalent in the study areas despite more than 66 years of independence.\nb. To get an insight into the educational level of the people concerned such as the\nculprits, the victims and area/community people etc.\nc. To find out the views of the victims/ local area people with regard to the Khap\nPanchayats.\nd. To get a clear picture of the violence against couples, girls in villages and cities.\ne. To identify the inadequacy of the laws made by the Parliament to curb the atrocities\nof the Khap Panchayat and the Kangaroo courts.\nf. To find out the role of the law enforcement agencies, governmental bodies and\nconcerned authorities.\ng. To know the status of the victims of unfair and discriminatory decisions\npassed/given by the Khap Panchayats and the kangaroo courts.\nh. To give suggestions on the reformation and improvement of the present legal system.\n1.2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\nThe researcher adopted purposive sampling technique, through which states are selected\nbased on data available in (source name), the purpose is to find why these States are suffering with\nsuch problems. For conducting the study on the aforesaid topic following 4 States were chosen:\n17 A 20-year-old tribal woman was allegedly gang-raped in a West Bengal village on the orders of a shalishi\nsabha for falling in love with a man from outside her community and then failing to cough up Rs. 50,000 fine\nimposed by the shalishi sabha, which eventually led to the woman being humiliated with a dozen men\nassaulting her dignity.\n10\ni. State of Haryana\nii. State of Uttar Pradesh (Western U.P.)\niii. State of West Bengal\niv.

Such sampling is not based on representation but\nincludes different kinds of stakeholders. The research team employed multiple methods in order to\nvalidate the reliability of the data generated. The methods used for study were Focussed Group\nDiscussion (FGD), Group discussion, observation and in depth case study. Audio recording of\nFGD and case study were also made. For the purpose of the study, for each state the category of\nsample included in the study were -\ni. Affected Women (victims)\nii. Members of Khap Panchayat\niii. Local Area People\niv. Authorities Concerned\nAs the main focus of the study is on women and the impact of quasi-judicial systems like\nkhap Panchayat, Kangaroo courts etc on the lives of the women, the main target group is women,\nhowever, researcher collected data from other people ie., members of khap Panchayat, local area\npeople and authorities concerned (police personnel, District Magistrate etc.) for the purpose of\ngetting a broader/true picture of the issues.\nThe entire data collection was done during the month of April-June2014.

The proposed draft bill on honor killings by the National\nCommission for Women and the proposed draft bill on prevention of unlawful assemblies by\nthe Law Commission of India along with the consultation paper were also reviewed and\nanalysed with great depth\n16\nChapter- 2\nBACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\nKHAP PANCHAYAT, KANGAROO COURTS AND SHALISHI\nADALATS IN INDIA\n2.1 INTRODUCTION\nKhap Panchayat, Kangaroo courts, Shalishi Adalats(Bengali equivalents of Khap\nPanchayats) and other parallel judicial bodies have constantly been in the news off lately for all the\nwrong reasons, be it butchering of innocent lovers or gang rape of woman for falling in love with\nsomeone outside community, imposing ban on girls use of mobiles or restrictions on their wearing\njeans or not giving them proper rights to female. Khap Panchayat is the union of few villages,\nmainly found in north India though it exists in similar forms in the rest of the country also. They\nhave emerged as quasi-judicial bodies that pronounce harsh punishments based on age-old\ncustoms and traditions, often bordering on regressive measures to modern problems. Some of the\ndiktats are gross violations of human rights putting humanity to shame.\nThese extra constitutional khap Panchayats and kangaroo style courts try to legitimize their\nactions by quoting historical antecedents of uncertain origin to support their practices. They are of\nthe opinion that the Khap Panchayat is an age old institution, having its foundation in the early\nmedieval period.18 It is quite alarming that in a democratic country like India with an extensive\nand strong judicial system and local self-government institutions like elected Panchayats, there\nexists a pseudo-judicial institutions like the Khap Panchayats, Shalishi Adalats are the institution\nwhich has been staking claim to legitimacy when it comes to resolving disputes of local public or\nother welfare measures. Had these institutions been dispensing justice fairly by applying the\n18 Suraj Bhan Bhardwaj, \u201cMyth and Reality of the Khap Panchayats: a Historical Analysis of the Panchayat\nand Khap Panchayat,\u201d available at http://sih.sagepub.com/content/28/1/43.\n17\nprinciples of natural justice in consonance with the Constitutional spirit as embedded in the\nFundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy, a furor against their functioning\nwould not have been raised. In recent times, their role has been constantly under the scanner not\nonly because of the controversial decisions/diktats issued but also because of regressive comments\nmade by them.\nWith all the negative media coverage of projecting Khaps and other Kangaroo Courts as a\nhangover of regressive medieval history, it is somehow assumed that khaps are a burden on the\nsociety in which they exist. However, in December 2012, a survey carried out by a sub-committee\nconstituted by Haryana Backward Class Commission (HBCC) to ascertain the possibility of\nreservation for jaats and other communities found out that traditional Haryanvi people have more\nfaith in social Panchayats than judicial courts and prefer to approach khaps for remedial\nmeasures.19 The survey which was conducted on 49,870 households in rural areas highlighted that\n66.6% families from 16 different castes said they preferred approaching khap Panchayats than\nopting for judicial remedies for seeking justice whenever disputes arise.20\nThis stark difference in the perception about khaps in media and the masses is not only\nsurprising but pointing towards a dangerous situation where ground realities are different from\nwhat is being projected in the popular media. The sensitive issue of Sagotra marriages is a major\ncause of khap Panchayat garnering mass support. Although, sagotra marriages are valid under the\nIndian law,21 there is popular sentiment against it, especially in the rural heartland of Haryana and\nWestern U.P. The khaps have been exploiting this in order to consolidate their power and secure\nmass support. Khap Panchayats want the law to be amended to disallow same-gotra marriages and\nhave been mobilizing political opinion for doing so.\n19 Manveer Saini, \u201cHaryana people prefer khaps over courts: Report\u201d reported in The Times of India dated\nDec 16, 2012, available at http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-12-16/india/35850111_1_khap-\npanchayats-sube-singh-samain-bhaichara.\n20 See Ibid.\n21 The Hindu Marriages Disabilities Removal Act, 1946 permitted sagotra marriages between two Hindus. The\nHindu Marriage Validity Act, 1949 further validated inter-caste marriages. Section 29 of the Hindu Marriage\nAct validates same-gotra marriages. The section, title \u201csavings\u201d, says that a marriage solemnized between\nHindus before the commencement of this Act, which is otherwise valid, shall not be deemed to be invalid or\never to have been invalid by reason only of the fact that the parties thereto belonged to the same gotra or\npravara or belonged to the different religions, castes or subdivisions of the same caste.\u201d\n18\nThe present study on the Discriminative and Derogatory Practices against Women By\nKhap Panchayats, Kangaroo Courts and Shalishi Adalats in India: An Empirical Study in the\nStates of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh(West), West Bengal & Rajasthan, has been undertaken as an\nattempt to discover the truth of khap Panchayats and other quasi judicial bodies and their impact\non the lives of women keeping all such aspects in sight.\n2.2 PANCHAYATS AND KHAPS\nDisposal of local disputes by \u201cPanchayat\u201d is an ancient Indian concept which is now\nconstitutionally recognised in the democratic State of India with the Panchayat representatives\nbeing now elected and the Panchayats constituted under the Panchayati Raj Act.22 At every social\nlevel, Panchayat action begins when men of a group, whether categorised by lineage or caste,\nmeets to deal with a problem that affects a particular group. Those who convene the meeting are\nones who feel endangered or discomfited by the problem and the ones who feel they are going to\nbe affected by it, attend the meeting. For arriving at a decision, the traditional Panchayat mobilizes\na large number of people on the basis of family, kin, gotra, caste, community and village including\npersons from outside the local area. Issues such as breaking of social taboos, customs, rituals, and\nhierarchy are used as mobilizing strategies. With their highly emotive strategies, these succeed in\nuniting people and closing ranks in rural society where people are more driven by emotions than\nlogic.\nThe enforcement of judgments by a Panchayat which is not constituted under law depends\non united public opinion and action. The use of force is always a lurking possibility in executing\nthe Panchayat\u2019s decision. Once the decision is taken, enforcement is the responsibility of the\nleaders of the village in which the penalized party lives. The sanctions applied by the caste or the\nvillage Panchayat are usually fining, nominal or substantial, which has to be deposited in a\n22 A 3-tier Panchayati Raj system - Gram Panchayat at the village level, Panchayat Samiti at the block level,\nand Zila Parishad at the district level was first adopted by state of Rajsthan in Nagor district on 2nd Oct 1958.\nThis system was adopted by various other state governments during the 1950s and 60s, by enacting laws to\nestablish panchayats. The system was given a constitutional stamp by the Indian Constitution, with the 73rd\namendment in 1992 to accommodate the idea. On 24 April 1993, the Constitutional (73rd Amendment) Act\n1992 came into force to provide constitutional status to the Panchayati Raj institutions. This act was extended\nto Panchayats in the tribal areas of eight states, namely Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Himachal\nPradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Rajasthan starting 24 December 1996. Currently, the\nPanchayati Raj system exists in all the states except Nagaland, Meghalaya and Mizoram, and in all Union\nTerritories except Delhi.\n19\ncommon fund of the Panchayat; ritual expiation; public humiliation, which would mean blacking\nthe face or rubbing the nose in dust before the aggrieved party or even the entire gathering,\ntouching other\u2019s feet, shaving the head, or drinking or dipping the nose in the urine of one or more\npersons. Orders of Panchayats to parade the penalised nude or gang rapes are not unheard of. The\nfinal weapon in the hands of traditional Panchayat is outcasting. Outcasting is an extreme form of\ngroup withdrawal.\nThe traditional caste Panchayats were part of the socio-political life of village\ncommunities even in the pre-colonial period. They were essentially informal, decision-making,\ncaste-based bodies of elderly-\u2018wise\u2019 men, drawn from their respective castes or from the dominant\ncaste group, who commanded universal respect in the community. These members were not\nelected or self-appointed but were members by concensus and sometimes by heredity. Inter-caste\nmatters are decided by the village Panchayat, which is called for a broad range of problems, both\ncivil and criminal in nature. The membership of this Panchayat consists of important leaders of\neach of the caste groups in the village. From available evidence, it is certain that these meetings\nhave always been controlled by the members of the dominant and the lower-caste groups, the\nformer (due to the integrated nature of the economic system and the virtual monopoly over land)\nare able to control the later and enforce decisions upon them. This is normally achieved through\nthreats of economic sanctions as well as using or threatening physical violence.\nThe strength of the traditional caste Panchayat lay in twin factors; one they are the\nnumerical strength of a particular caste group and two, the landownership it commanded. That is\nwhy the high visibility of the caste Panchayats is evidenced in Jaat dominated areas of Haryana\nand Western Uttar Pradesh. Basic to the exercise of power by the caste Panchayat was the\ndomination of jaats, constituting the single largest caste group in Haryana. According to 1931\ncensus, the districts of Rohtak, Hissar and Karnal had 36.80 percent, 28.48 percent and 15.20\npercent of Jaat population respectively. In these districts, the Jaats formed not only one-third of the\ntotal population but also held more than half of the agricultural land as proprietors, with the rest of\nthe land distributed among a large number of different caste groups.\nThe numerical strength in combination with landownership patterns meant that the\nlandowning class and upper-caste population of a village or a religion dominated the traditional\nPanchayats. We can say that these traditional Panchayats were all purpose local mechanisms for a\n20\nseries of activities ranging from collection of revenue or overseeing works of public utility, acting\nas courts for dispute settlement and meeting out justice in community matters. All this was\neffected within the framework of the cater rules, custom or usage of the locality, trade or family.\nThe exact origin of the khap Panchayats is largely unknown. Historically, it has been a\ndecentralized system of social administration in the north-western states like Haryana, Madhya\nPradesh and Punjab. Khap Panchayat is sort of tribal organization. It is a traditional and informal\norganization. It is a sociological as well as a political organization. It regulates not only the social\ncustoms of the dominant clan of the jaats of the Khap but also of the jaats of other clans living in\nits jurisdiction.\nThe khap Panchayats is to be distinguished from the caste Panchayats or biradari\nPanchayat of various castes for dealing with intra-caste social norms and disputes. Khap is a\ndifferent unit altogether. It is not made of one gotra but when more than three or four gotras\nassemble together and discuss some issue that is called a Khap Panchayat. Khap is thus a different\nform of Panchayat.\n2.3 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF KHAP PANCHAYATS\nAncient society had organized itself into clans or under Panchayat system. A clan at that\ntime was based on one large gotra or a number of closely related gotras. Decisions relating to the\nactivities of these social groups were made under the aegis and with the consensus of a Council of\nfive elected members. In time of danger, outside invasion, or other kinds of crises, the whole clan\nrallied under the banner of the Panchayat and a leader would be chosen by the Assembly. A\nnumber of villages grouped themselves into a Guhaand. A number of Guhaands formed a 'Khap'\n(covering an area equal to from a Tehsil to a District) and a number of Khaps formed a 'Sarva\nKhap' embracing a full province or state. For example, there was a \"Sarva Khap\" each for Haryana\nand Malwa. At what level a Panchayat should gather depended upon the magnitude of the problem\nand the territory it involved.\n21\nThe origin of the word \u2018Khap\u2019 is derived from the word \u2018faank\u2019, meaning an off-shoot or\nfraction.23 Historically the word \u2018Khap\u2019 was used for the first time in Rajasthan in the context of\nRajput ruling class during the medieval period. In Muhnaut Naiansi riyasat or the Khyats of\nMarwar State, we find that the word \u2018Khap\u2019 has extensively been used in the context of different\nsects of the Rajput ruling class. The first Census report based on religion and caste was prepared in\nJodhpur in the year 1890\u20131891, thereby dividing the people of India on the basis of religion and\ncaste. Even the castes were divided on the basis of gotras. The word \u2018Khap\u2019 has come into\nexistence in the said Census report. When it was translated into Hindi, the word class instead of\nbeing coined as \u2018gotra\u2019 was termed as \u2018Khap\u2019. Khaps are largely believed to be started by upper\ncaste jaats in the fourteenth century, to consolidate their power and position. Each clan has a\nhereditary head man called as chaudhry. However some of the jaat clans have called this position\nas secretary (wazir). The clan head man is also the head man of Khap council. In case of Haryana,\nthe head of khap Panchayat is elected in formal manner through consensus.\nKhap Panchayat is an exclusively male dominated institution and the women have no share\nor say in it. Although the Khap leaders claim that they hold their women-sisters, daughters and\nmothers in high esteem and are prepared to make supreme sacrifice for safeguarding their honour.\nThe women have largely remained excluded from it.\n\u201cKhap\u201d is an ancient concept which has written references found back from the Rig Vedic\ntimes. There are basically social-political groups, which usually comprise the upper caste and\nelderly men who are united by geography and caste. Hence, Khap is a term for a social political\ngrouping and used in geographical sense. Khap was a system of social administration and\norganization in the republics of North-western states like Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan in\nIndia since ancient times. Khap Panchayats have had a long innings in the Jaat-dominated areas\nof north-western India and some of their decisions that go against individual rights have led to\nheated controversy. It is commonly believed that they came into existence sometime around 600\nAD. It is believed to have been started by the upper caste \u2018Jaats\u2019 to consolidate their power and\nposition in the community.24\n23 Supra note 1 at 47.\n24 Saumya Ramakrishnan, \u201cKhaps - Is history now becoming a burden?,\u201d Published January 18, 2013\navailable at http://barandbench.com/content/212/khaps-history-now-becoming-burden#.U1T2r1X6NIg.\n22\nKhap is a cluster of villages united by caste and geography. Each village is governed by the\nPanchayat, which is an elected council and the elected members of all the villages in the cluster\nwould then choose a khap leader, who would then convene the meeting of khap Panchayats. The\nmain feature of a khap is that all boys and girls within a Khap are considered as siblings and a\nKhap Panchayat governs the Khap formed by same gotra (clan) families from several\nneighbouring villages. Khap Panchayats are prevalent in Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh and parts\nof Rajasthan. Love marriages are considered taboo in areas governed by Khap Panchayats. Those\nliving in a Khap are not allowed to marry in the same gotra or even in any gotra from the same\nvillage. Many young couples have been killed in the past defying Khap rules. Khap Panchayat\nimposes its writ through social boycotts and fines and in most cases end up either killing or forcing\nthe victims to commit suicide. All this is done in the name of brotherhood and honour. Honour has\nalways existed in one form or the other within most communities and often operates to constrain\nwomen\u2019s behaviour.25 Although a common misperception links honour primarily with cultures in\nthe Middle East and Asian countries, honour functions in similarly gendered ways around the\nworld.26 It is the woman who is the subject of honour and not her male partner. However, in a huge\nchange witnessed, on April 21, 2014, the biggest Khap Panchayat in Haryana, the satrol khap\nscripted history by allowing inter-caste marriages which have led to a lot of bloodshed in the\npast.27\n2.4. REASONS FOR DOMINANCE OF KHAPS AND KANGAROO\nCOURTS\nKhaps and kangaroo courts have a great hold on the masses as is clearly reflected in the\nempirical study conducted during the period of this study project. Following are some of the\nvarious reasons which can be attributed for such dominance of khaps/kangaroo courts.\n2.4.1 Weakness of the elected Panchayati Raj Institutions\n25 Johanna Bond, \u201cHonour as Property,\u201d 23 Colum. J. Gender & L. 202(2012).\n26 Ibid.\n27 See Report by Manveer Saini, in The Times of India, dated April 21, 2014 \u201cHaryana\u2019s biggest khap\nPanchayat scripts history, allows inter-caste marriages,\u201d available at\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Haryanas-biggest-khap-panchayat-scripts-history-allows-inter-caste-\nmarriages/articleshow/34016585.cms.\n23\nThe inherent weakness of democratically elected Panchayati Raj institutions is one major\nreason why the Khap Panchayats and other parallel quasi judicial bodies have emerged as\npowerful units in the rural heartlands of Haryana and U.P (West). The Panchayati Raj Institution\nboasts of having 33% reservation for women. But such a reservation ends up elected women\ncandidates as mere proxies of their men folk. The elections for elected Panchayats again are\ninfluenced by caste factor majorly due to which khaps overpower PRI.\n2.4.2 Political failure\nDespite the blatant disregard of human rights by certain khap/kangaroo courts, the State\nespecially the political class doesn\u2019t seem to take much interest in putting a leash on the growing\npower of khaps. The major reason behind it lies in the caste based vote dynamics. No political\nleader in whose constituency khaps fall, in his right mind would dare to rub the khap chaudharies\nin the wrong, doing so would essentially mean the end of political career in that constituency.\nFor every politician aiming to get a hold on the jat vote tries to justify the khaps. Haryana\nChief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal are at least\ntwo examples of such politicians. Mr. Hooda compared khap Panchayats akin to \u201cNGOs\u201d and a\npart of Indian culture. Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal said that he saw no reason to ban\nthese bodies, as they serve a \u201ccultural purpose.\u201d28\nWhat cultural purpose khaps serve apart from maintaining a strict patriarchal hold in the\nsociety is a question every sensible person would ask. To quote former Union Finance Minister P.\nChidambaram who believed the khap Panchayats to be retrograde organizations that cannot be a\npart of India\u2019s culture- \u201cI am appalled to see somebody say it is a part of India\u2019s culture\u201d29\n2.4.3 Judicial Delays and Distrust of System\nDelay in administration of justice by normal courts is one reason why villagers and local\npeople defend these caste Panchayats, shalishi adalats etc. is that they deliver the verdict in one\n28 Report by Anant Zanane, \u201cMarriages within clan cause dishonour killings, Supreme Court should not get\ninto this mess: Khap leader, dated February 19, 2014 available at\nhttp://www.ndtv.com/article/india/marriages-within-clan-cause-dishonour-killings-supreme-court-should-not-\nget-into-this-mess-khap-lead-485630.\n29 Report by Chander Suta Dogra, \u201cRetrograde avatar of repressive traditions\u201d The Hindu. dated 11th February\n2014\n24\nsitting whereas court cases drag for years. There is also a general distrust amongst the villagers of\nthe law enforcement agencies. According to them, in many cases innocent people get harassed in\nthe court and by police. The Panchs are all known, so the villagers trust them and are confident\nthat the panchayats cross check everything to ensure neutrality and administer justice.\n2.4.4 Socio Economic Factors\nWomen too, surprisingly support khap diktats for various reasons suiting their socio-\neconomic situations. After a mahapanchayat of 52 villages banned girls from wearing jeans (what\nit termed the \u201cdenim devil), going out alone or using mobile phones a number of girls in the region\nfelt bad but were of the view that the Panchayats other decisions- like not having DJ music in\nweddings or banning gifts of expensive items like tractors or motorcycles as dowry \u2013 were far\nmore important and worthy of respect. As for the ban on jeans and mobile phones which holds in\nthe case of unmarried girls, they happily bear to live with it.30 Rekha, a teenager from Neemgaon,\nsaid jeans and mobiles were \"not the end of the world, and not quite as necessary for girls as clean\nair and water.\" She further added perspective by mentioning that because of the khaps diktat her\nfather would not be able to gamble and drink alcohol and also due to the steps taken by the khap\nPanchayat the incidents of sexual harassment would decrease.31\n2.5 THE COMMON DISCRIMINATIVE AND DEROGATORY PRACTICES\nBY KHAP PANCHAYATS\nIn some Haryana villages, the young girls are routinely threatened, abused and killed under\nKhap verdicts. It is acceptable for the families to feed pesticide pills to the teenage girls and then\ndispose off their bodies by burning them without any police records. The entire onus of\nsiblinghood rests on the girl. She is the keeper of village honour. Sometimes rules are bending for\nthe boys but a girl is never allowed to bend the rules. If a couple runs away then the families risk\n30 \"I will abide by the Panchayat\u2019s directions not because I don't like jeans, but because some very good\ndecisions have been taken. There is a check on dowry and liquor sale in the villages, and these have been\nruining families. Fathers have been selling land to get daughters married,\" said Sonal, an undergraduate\nstudent from Barsana village. See report by Ishita Mishra in the Times of India dated March 26, 2014, \u201cGirls\nwelcome khap Panchayat diktat on dowry, say they can live with ban on jeans,\u201d available at\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/Girls-welcome-khap-panchayat-diktat-on-dowry-say-they-can-\nlive-with-ban-on-jeans/articleshow/32738501.cms\n31 See Ibid.\n25\nthe boycott and hefty fines in lakhs of rupees. Even the other women of the house can suffer abuse.\nIn keeping with the Khap rules, older villages try to keep the young people apart. Some schools\nare also forced to have separate timings for the boys and girls. Fearing their daughters would go\nastray, many parents marry them off at an early age. People have unquestionable faith in the\njustice of Khap. The question of rights for women does not exist anywhere in the territories ruled\nby Khap Panchayats.\nThe functioning of Khap Panchayats can be analyzed by studying the various forms in\nwhich they are imposed in the area wherein they claim their jurisdiction. These practices are seen\nin many of the forms which are being imposed on the people. These include:\n2.5.1. Honour Killing\nHonour killings are the major reason why khaps have been attracting all the negative media\ncoverage. In recent times, there have been many reports of honour killings in various forms which\nare more or less being attributed to the khap diktats. Human Rights Watch defines honour crimes\nas \"acts of violence, usually murder, committed by male family members against female family\nmembers who are perceived to have brought dishonour upon the family.\"32 Such \"dishonourable\nacts\" include seeking divorce, adultery, premarital sexual relations, premarital pregnancy, or being\nthe victim of a sexual assault or rape. However, honour crimes are by no means limited to these\ncircumstances, as a wide range of activities can trigger suspicion of dishonourable activity and\nresult in subsequent attacks or killings of victim.\nNotions of honour serve as barometers of familial worth.33 Honour can be analysed as a\nrelativistic concept, i.e; conflicts between individuals and even cultures arising as a consequence\nof material circumstances and ambition rather than fundamental differences in principle. It can\nalso be viewed as nativist, as being real and so intrinsically attached to human condition, just as\nlove, care, affection derive from the formative personal bonds that establish ones personal dignity\nand character.\n32 Human Rights Watch, Integration of the Human Rights of Women and the Gender Perspective: Violence\nagainst Women and \"Honour\" Crimes, Intervention Before the 57th Session of the U.N. Commission on\nHuman Rights (Apr. 6, 2001), available at http://www.hrw.org/press/2001/04/un_oral12_0405.htm.\n33 Mazna Hussain, \u201c\u2019Take My Riches. Give Me Justice\u2019: A Contextual Analysis of Pakistan's Honour Crimes\nLegislation,\u201d 29 Harv. J.L. & Gender 227.\n26\nHonour is frequently if not always gendered. Communities value women, at least in part,\nfor the honour they bring to their families and punish women for the shame that they bring to their\nfamilies for alleged transgressions of social and sexual norms.34 Although expectations for\nwomen's behaviour vary somewhat from country to country, honour is a common theme, requiring\nwomen to adhere strictly to social norms. The social pressure to conform to norms of chastity and\nvirginity is strong, and many families police the behaviour of unmarried daughters and sisters to\nensure compliance with these social dictates.35 Women are forced to consider every aspect of their\nlife from the perspective of their \u2018honour\u2019 as a quality which is essential to reflect both the entirety\nof their social worth as well as the reputation of the male members of the family. Male reputation\nis quintessentially deemed to be dependent upon female honour. Female honour is passive in\nnature, completely centring around the expected behaviour of subordinance, modesty and\nendurance, whereas male honour is by nature, dynamic, centring around qualities of self assertion,\ndominance and heightened propensity towards flaunting social status.\nGender roles are generally patriarchal in nature. Wives and daughters are expected to be\nsub-ordinate even servile to their fathers and husbands and sons. A women\u2019s role is restricted to be\nthat of dutiful daughter an obedient wife and self sacrificing mother. They are not expected to\nshow any kind of autonomy and are supposed to work without complaint. Young women are\ndisempowered both as women and through their youth. Any perceived rebellion against the\ntraditional expected behaviour may be construed as a loss of honour and might result in coercion\nor violence perpetrated by the woman's biological family, ranging from bullying, and beating even\nto murder. The most widely recognized reason for the same is the killing of both spouses for\nmarrying in the same sub-caste, a practice which was widely endorsed and enforced by the Khap\nPanchayats in Haryana.\nShame, as a corollary of honour, operates to control and regulate women\u2019s sexuality and\nfreedom of movement by the male members of the family. Women who dare to fall in love, choose\ntheir life partner, choose to move out of a unhappy marriage, engage in extramarital relationships,\nseek divorce are considered to have transgressed the boundaries of \u201cappropriate\u201d behaviour\nconforming to socially accepted sexual behaviour. It is the \u2018regulation\u2019 of such behaviour which in\nextreme cases involves horrific direct violence, including \u2018honour killing.\u2019 Honour which is seen\n34 John Alan Cohan, \u201cHonour Killings and the Cultural Defense,\u201d 40 Cal. W. Int'l L.J. 177 (2010).\n35 See supra note 8.\n27\nas a social quality revolving around public perception of individuals rather than their actual\nbehaviour causing scandal or gossip within the community is the most significant aspect of an\noffence against honour. However, ultimately it is within the power of those men who with the\ninternalization of the honour code through the policing of younger women, decide what acts are\nhonourable and which bring them dishonour. Some actions which are strongly linked with honour-\nbased violence are- loss of virginity outside marriage, pre-marital pregnancy, infidelity, extra-\nmarital relationship, asking for divorce or asking for custody of children after divorce, leaving the\nfamily or marital home without permission, causing scandal or gossip in the community or falling\nvictim to rape.\nIn some cases an honour killing may be a formal collective decision made by a council of\nfamily members who not only decide whether the girl or women\u2019s behaviour merits death but may\nalso plan how the murder will be committed and who will carry out. In such a case the chances of\nthe family for giving the insult to their honour are rare and a potential victim may need protection\nin perpetuity, especially where the family can call upon an extended network of relatives, friends\nand associates to assist them. Some honour killings are less structured but still carry the same\ncollective pressure and the same motivation to monitor or guard women\u2019s behaviour in order to\nshow the commitment towards a dominating patriarchal society with the object of having a\ndeterrent effect on other girls who might be voicing against the restrictions dominating their lives.\nIn order to understand the functioning of a Khap Panchayat it is first important to\nunderstand Honour killings. Honour killings are murder committed by family members and the\npeople belonging to the concerned caste/class of family members who believe that the acts of the\nvictim have brought extreme and inexcusable shame and dishonour on the family name. This\nproposition of family killing their own daughter or sisters is prominently highlighted in the current\nstudy when the researchers visit khap villages in Haryana.36 Another stark reality is that most of\nthe honour killings have been reported from those areas where Khap Panchayats are more active.\nThese killing are given shape by the ruthless rules of Khap system which takes away their lives\nwith barbaric ferocity. People living in a Khap are not allowed to marry in same gotra from the\nsame village. The rationale behind this, they argue is that people belonging to same gotra are\nbelieved to be from the same clan or family lineage and thus brothers and sisters.\n36 See chapter 4.\n28\nHowever, surprisingly, it is not the same gotra marriage which is the major reason for\nhonour killings. A recent study commissioned by NCW, which was conducted by NGO Shakti\nVahini revealed that 72% of the 326 cases of honour crimes were in fact inter-caste marriages,\nwhile same gotra marriages were only 3 percent.37 These facts point out that honour killings are\nmore or less the outcome of clash between tradition and modernity and have more to do with the\ncaste system than the gotra.\nThe statistics might be more inclined to show that the honour killings are more as a\nreaction to the inter-caste marriages but the issue of sagotra marriage cannot be said to be less\nimportant. It is the gotra which in reality binds the khaps and opposition to sagotra marriages is in\nreality the major factor which is helping the khap garner mass support. By creating the false\nimpression that all marriages of choice between young couples are incestuous, what Khaps are\nactually opposing is the right to choose marriage partner. There have been several instances of\nKhaps issuing dictates in matters where the marriage was not an intra-gotra marriage, yet married\ncouples were declared siblings, and their families made to suffer boycotts. As couples are\nselectively targeted, it is clear the real motive is to control women\u2019s sexuality to ensure that her\nshare in the property remains within the patriarchal caste domain. Men may also occasionally fall\nvictim to honour killings but they are rarely killed by their own family but by the relatives of the\nwomen or girl who is supposedly dishonoured by the victim. However men usually have greater\nbargaining power and may sometimes escape death by paying the other family of with money or\nwomen or they might be spared because their tribal or community connections. Some reported\nincidents of Honour killings by khap Panchayats as reported in national media are,\nThe Panchayat angry over the marriage ordered gouging of eyes of the couple who eloped\nand got married in the thakur dominated ghori bachera village not far from national capital, before\nshooting them as it felt that it had brought a bad name for the entire village. The family\nsurprisingly were not a part of the decision of Panchayat. 38\nIn another horrifying incident, a brother on discovering his married sister living with an old\nboyfriend, stormed into the home and dragged her onto the street in broad daylight and to the\n37 The Hindu, Aug 6, 2010, p 11\n38 Panchayat orders gouging lovers\u2019 eyes, Deccan Herald; February 12, 2012\nHonour Killings / Crimes in India http://www.deccanherald.com/content/59009/panchayat-orders-gouging-\nlovers-eyes.html.\n29\nhorror of the passers-by cut off her head while saying \"she had sinned and had to be punished\".\nHe later on walked into the police station and placed the head of his sister, along with the butcher\nknife that decapitated her, on the table in front of the officer in charge.39\nA 17-year-old girl, a resident of Khoraon village, Kaushambi in Uttar Pradesh, was hacked\nto death by her father for having an affair with a 20-year-old from another religion from the same\nvillage.40 Such killings are not restricted geographically to North India, in the south, a 19-year-old\nwoman in Sangameshwar village in Dharwad, Karnataka, was allegedly killed and burnt by her\nparents.41\nJasbeer, the only earning member of his family was brutally murdered after his hands were\nchopped off and legs cut with swords and other sharp-edged weapons by a group of four angry\nRajputs in broad daylight in a local market. His fault hailing from the Jaat community, Jasbeer had\ndared to marry his neighbour a Rajput girl. The decomposed bodies of a boy and a girl were\nrecovered from the fields. The couple were neighbours and wanted to marry. They were killed by\nthe boy\u2019s family. Inder was forcibly married two months before.\nAnother killing in the name of \"honour\" and there has been a surge in such attacks over the\npast several months. Her brother discovered his sister was living with an old boyfriend, stormed\ninto the home and dragged her onto the street in broad daylight. Passers-by looked on in horror as\nhe cut off her head while saying \"she had sinned and had to be punished\". The policeman\njumped to his feet as the man walked into the station and placed the head of his sister, along with\nthe butcher knife that decapitated her, on the table in front of him. But the coverage - or so to say,\nthe lack of it - failed to hide the true extent of a scourge that bedevils many Indian women. In a\nsimilar incident, a girl was hacked to death by her father for having an affair from another\nreligion. In the south, a woman was allegedly killed and burnt by her parents on December 23.42\nIn another incident that was brought to justice by court of law, five members of a family\nwere sentenced to death for the torture and \u201cbrutal\u201d murder of a young couple from Delhi for\n39Chaitra Arjunpuri, \u201cHonour Killings\u201d Bring Dishonour to India, dated December 27, 2012 available at\nhttp://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/12/2012121614107670788.html.\n40 Ibid.\n41 Ibid.\n42 See report by Chaitra Arjunpuri, \u201cHonour killings bring dishonour to India,\u201d dated December 27, 2012, Al\nJazeera.

A taxi\ndriver, wanted to marry the daughter of a vegetable vendor, but the girl\u2019s family was against the\nalliance because the boy belonged to a lower caste. India has seen an upsurge in such killings,\nwhich mainly involve young couples who marry outside their caste or against their relatives\u2019\nwishes and are murdered to protect what is seen as the family\u2019s reputation and pride. Autopsy\nreports revealed that the young couple had been tied with ropes, beaten with metal pipes and\nelectrocuted, local media news claimed. \u201cMedical examination had revealed that the two had died\ndue to the thermoelectric shock from repeated electrocution.\u201d According to the Public prosecutor\n\u201cAll the five persons were handed the death penalty because it was proved beyond doubt that they\ntortured and killed the young boy and girl just because they were in love and wanted to marry. The\nmurders were brutal and deliberate.43\nSome grisly cases that have been reported in the media in recent times from different\nregions in the country include that of Dharmender Barak and Nidhi Barak, who paid a heavy price\nfor defying their families and falling in love. The couple, from a village in the northern state of\nHaryana, were tortured, mutilated and killed in public view by the girl\u2019s father and their relatives\nwhen they tried to elope. A friend the couple had confided in leaked their plans to the girl\u2019s\nparents, who lured them back with assurances, only to allegedly kill them in the cruel most\nmanners.44\n2.5.2 Forced Marriage\nIn traditional societies, marriage is essentially a private domain concerning the family and\nthe community. A marriage performed by pressurizing one or both the parties and without their\nfree will and full consent is considered to be a forced marriage. Articles 16 of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights (UDHR), guarantees the consent to marriage as a basic human right.\nHowever, cultures which are obsessed with honour have a dominant feature of arranged marriage.\nThis doesn\u2019t imply that all cultures where marriages are arranged are ones where a potential\nhonour killing might occur; rather it is violence which is risk within culture where the consent of\n43See Report dated October 5, 2012 in AFP News, \u201cFive condemned to death for India \u2018honour\u2019\nkilling,\u201davailable at http://tribune.com.pk/story/447432/five-condemned-to-death-for-india-honour-killing/.\n44 See Report by Nupur Basu dated Nov 30, 2013 in Al Jazeera, Honour Killings \u2013 India\u2019s Crying Shame,\u201d available at\nhttp://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/11/honour-killings-india-crying-shame-20131127105910392176.html\n31\nthe individual is given less importance than the will of the parents and wider family and where\nmarriages are considered a union of two families rather than of individuals. Seen in this context it\nmay be considered acceptable to force an individual into marriage against their will keeping the\ninterest of family in mind.\nChild marriages where the couples are engaged as infants, is an example of a non-\nconsensual marriage as the children are unable to give their consent. Such marriages are common\nin societies that cling to the notion of honour. Early marriage is favoured in such societies as\nprophylactic against dishonour as the girls married of in early adolescence or even before have\nlittle chances to form a relationship of their own choice, thus leaving no scope of dishonour by\nrejecting a match chosen for them by the family.\nKhaps often declare marriage between two adults belonging to same village or gotra as\nillegal and force the female spouse to marry another person who belongs to a different gotra. It is\nconsidered to be a form of domestic violence. In spite of increasing number of such cases society,\npolice and law is turning a blind eye to such incidents and it has been noted that people falling\nprey to such forced marriages have to undergo both mental and physical torture.\nSome reported incidents of Forced marriages by khaps as reported in papers are-\nA girl whose marriage was performed by her relatives against her wishes ended her life by\nsetting herself ablaze. She was reportedly depressed as the marriage was performed against her\nwishes and off lately she doused herself in kerosene and set herself afire.45\nAn unmarried girl was allegedly burnt to death by her father and uncle for refusing to\nmarry the chosen groom. She was dumped in a pit and set ablaze.46\n2.5.3 Limitations on Personal Liberty\nRecently a dictum issued by the Khap Panchayat of Uttar Pradesh village which created an\nuproar in the country as it targeted women on the basis of gender. According to their dictum,\nwomen who are below 40 years of age should make minimal use of mobiles, go out with a male\n45 See the report in The Hindu, dated January 27, 2014 \u201cMinor ends life after being forced into marriage.\u201d\n46 See report dated July 08, 2011, \u201cDishonour Killing: Father burns daughter to death,\u201d available at\nhttp://zeenews.india.com/news/uttar-pradesh/dishonor-killing-father-burns-daughter-to-death_718314.html.\n32\nand also banned love marriage. This dictum created waves throughout the country and also voice\nPanchayats are raised about what legal validity of such dictum is issued by so called Khap at.\nThese types of dictum create suspicion in our mind whether we are really living in 21st century.\nSociologists and activists blame the killings to warped mindsets, as showcased by a recent\nban imposed by village elders in the eastern state of Bihar on the use of mobile phones by women.\nThe elders of Sunderbari village announced a $180 fine if a single women or girl is caught using a\ncell phone, saying the technology spurred sexual relationships, even extramarital affairs. Married\nwomen face a 2000 Rs penalty.\nThe ban is justified by its enforcers by holding the mobile phone responsible for debasing\nthe social atmosphere as even married women are allegedly deserting their husbands to elope with\nlovers, which is a shameful thing for the society, hence the diktat in order to tackle with the\nsituation. It is not the first time in India that village councils have banned women from publicly\nusing mobile phones. A similar prohibition was imposed for girls below age 18\nin Udaipurwati in Rajasthan State. A female phone ban was also ordered on the streets of\nBaghpat district in Uttar Pradesh state.\nIn this context Activist Madhu Kishwar contended that parents and relatives have the right\nto be concerned about girls in the family. \"We should avoid attacking people in different cultures\nwithout understanding the specific complexities of the situation.\"\nUnderstanding the male mindset should obviously be the first step. But as Prabhavalkar\nsays, perhaps the most necessary move is establishing gender sensitivity in Indian society.\"This\nwill do wonders in the long run,\" she says and hopefully, \"honour killings\" will no more besmirch\nIndia's reputation.47\nFurther in a move endorsing the retrogressive diktats of Panchayats, women of a cluster of\nvillages in Muzaffarnagar have decided to burn jeans and tops. The decision was taken at woman\nPanchayats held at Dudaherdi, Moghpur and Mansoorpur villages of Muzaffarnagar. The three\nPanchayats, attended by women from all ages, have already announced their decision to throw\naway jeans and tops from their wardrobe and have started a movement to mobilize support from\nall the other khaps in the country.\n47 Chaitra Arjunpuri, Female mobile phone bans, Al Jazeera 27 Dec 2012.\n33\nSubhash Baliyan, the general secretary of 'Sarva Khap' (the umbrella organization of all the\n360 khaps in India), said that the topmost khap body of the country had decided to direct all the\nmembers in the country to include elder women of their respective areas while discussing woman-\nrelated issues. \"This new provision will ensure that before announcing any decision related to\nwomen, the chaudhry (head) of the particular khap would discuss the issue with his wife before\nmaking the announcement.\u201d\nA senior Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Sohanviri, who is mobilizing support for\nboycott of jeans and cell phones by young women, said that the decision to torch the western\noutfits like jeans and tops was taken at an all-woman Panchayat held at the residence of the former\nMoghpur village pradhan Reshpal Singh. \u201cWe have spoken to the woman folk of the village and\nnot a single of them has objected to the proposal, be it a housewife or a college-going girl.\u201d While\nmost of the political parties have maintained a silence on the diktat of Aasara village khap\nPanchayat, a host of Jaat leaders have shown their resentment over the manner the issues is being\nhighlighted. \"The manner in which the media has projected khaps is shocking. Elders in every\nfamily tell their children about the dos and don'ts and expect them to follow their advice. This is\nprecisely what we are doing on a village level,\" says Baliyan Khap's chaudhry Naresh Tikait.\nA senior Jaat leader Yashpal Mallick, who is also the president of the All India Jaat\nReservation Committee and has been defending khaps time and again, said: \"The media has\nprojected that the restrictions are only for women. But this is not true. Even young boys have been\nbarred from using cell phones unless and until the need is beyond talking to their friends and\nfamilies. We have also mooted boycott of families indulging in dowry, but the media has not\nprojected that at all.\"\nWhile the UP government remains evasive about the \"anti-women\" diktat of khap\nPanchayats an amicus curie appointed by the Supreme Court has suggested proactive police action\nagainst such them.48The idea behind the move, it is believed, is to counter allegations that the\nfairer sex was being given an unfair deal by khaps which have only male as their members. Many\n48 Chaitra Arjunpuri, Female mobile phone bans. Al Jazeera 27 Dec 2012 11:59\n34\ncall the provision eyewash. As the wife of any chaudhry dare say no to what her husband has\napproved.\nThe sudden emergence of all-woman Panchayats in western UP ever since the Baghpat\nvillage khap controversy came into the light is also being viewed as a desperate attempt of khaps\nto establish that the women in such communities also have a say in the decision-making process.\n2.5.4 Property Rights\nBesides approving honour killings, ban on liberty, in recent years, khap Panchayats have\nmounted a campaign against the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act 2005 that gives equal\ninheritance rights to women. Last July, a khap in Jhajjar forbade a farmer from giving his daughter\nsome money in return for withdrawing a legal case that she had filed to get her share of the\nfamily\u2019s ancestral land. The reasoning being that it would embolden other girls to follow suit.\nActivists in Haryana have for long been saying that the opposition to same gotra or inter caste\nmarriages by khaps is actually aimed at preventing the economic empowerment of girls because\nthose who choose their own marriage partners are more likely to go on and demand their share of\nancestral land. All women are impliedly expected to leave their property share, in case anyone\ndares to ask for property share, blood relations ceases to exist. To avoid any conflict after a girls\u2019\nmarriage (arranged or love),the recent tradition in Haryana is to get her property share transferred\nin the name of the male members.\nThe adverse publicity that the khaps got as a result of their support for honour killings\ntriggered some course correction and there is now, a conscious effort to refurbish their much\ndented image by projecting a socially responsible facade. But this change is more cosmetic than\nfundamental. Bibipur village in Jind district where the local sarpanch held women\ndriven sarvkhap Panchayat comprising several major khaps of Haryana. The agenda was to\ncombat female foeticide and scores of women were invited to participate. But as soon as some\nwomen activists tried to raise the issue of equal share of girls in ancestral property and how\nwomen are being denied this right, they were shooed off the stage.\n2.5 KANGAROO COURTS IN INDIA\n35\nA Kangaroo court is a judicial tribunal or assembly that blatantly disregards recognized\nstandards of law or justice, and often carries little or no official standing in the territory within\nwhich it resides. Merriam-Webster defines it as \"a mock court in which the principles of law and\njustice are disregarded or perverted\". A kangaroo court is often held by a group or a community\nto give the appearance of a fair and just trial, even though the verdict has in reality already been\ndecided before the trial has begun. Such courts typically take place in rural areas where legitimate\nlaw enforcement may be limited. The term may also apply to a court held by a legitimate judicial\nauthority who intentionally disregards the court's legal or ethical obligations.49\nIt is a self-appointed or mob-operated tribunal that disregards or parodies existing\nprinciples of law or human rights, especially one in a frontier area or among criminals in prison. It\nis also a crudely or irregularly operated court, i.e. one so controlled as to render a fair trial\nimpossible. A kangaroo court or kangaroo trial, sometimes likened to a drumhead court-martial,\nrefers to a sham legal proceeding or court. The colloquial phrase \u201ckangaroo court\u201d is used to\ndescribe judicial proceedings that deny due process rights in the name of expediency. Such rights\ninclude, the right to summon witnesses, the right of cross-examination, the right not to incriminate\noneself, the right not to be tried on secret evidence, the right to control one\u2019s own defence, the\nright to exclude evidence that is improperly obtained, irrelevant or inherently inadmissible, e.g.,\nhearsay, the right to exclude judges or jurors on the grounds of partiality or conflict of interest, and\nmost importantly the right of appeal.\nThe outcome of a trial by \u201ckangaroo court\u201d is essentially determined in advance, usually\nfor the purpose of providing a conviction, either by going through the motions of manipulated\nprocedure or by allowing no defence at all.50 These Panchayats are strikingly similar to the Khap\nPanchayats of Haryana insofar as issuing dictates and awarding punishments such as fines and\nsocial boycotts. Predictably, women are kept away from these kangaroo courts.\nKangaroo courts/Katta Panchayats are unofficially run, and are in fact usurped powers by\nrowdies, who rule and run parallel governance in India. While such kangaroo courts are present\nelsewhere also they are more common in India than elsewhere. In the case of Kangaroo courts\npracticed in India, the rowdies who pass these judgments, always award the punishments to\n49 Supra note. 1\n50 See http://www.jeywin.com/main/blog/menace-of-kangaroo-courts-or-katta-panchayats-in-india/ for details.\n36\ninnocent people and free the actual culprits/criminals. Or if they punish a person that would be for\nsuch a silly reason that it does not warrant even a reprimand or a few abuses. But in Kangaroo\ncourts the punishment will be rape or amputations of men\u00b4s legs. Very rarely the actual culprits or\ncriminals would get the punishment through kangaroo courts.\nInterestingly all the law enforcing agencies including police, intelligence, judiciary and the\nofficialdom know about the operation of these kangaroo courts but none of them can do anything\nto stop them. The main reason is all the government agencies are passive or are active associates of\nthese kangaroo courts and the associated criminals. For any problem, crime, issue that is small or\nbig, constitutionally valid laws or courts are not given importance as the law enforcing agencies\nare there to mediate and investigate the cases. Certain judges have observed that many actions\ntaken by the Katta Panchayat result in deprivation of social status, access to basic facilities like\nfood, water and shelter, denial of cultural facilities like common worship, access to religious\nevents, etc., and denial of economic opportunities like employment, finances, etc. As such, these\nwould constitute violation of human rights guaranteed.\nIn January, 2014, a 20-year-old woman in West Bengal was gang-raped by 13 men on the\norders of a village court as punishment for having a relationship with a man from a different\ncommunity.51 Police said that her male companion was tied up in the village square, while the\nassault on the woman happened in a mud house. The police have arrested all the 13 men, including\nthe village chief who ordered the gang rape. The accused have been produced in court which\nremanded them to jail custody. The West Bengal victim's family told media that she was assaulted\nbecause the kangaroo court believed she had violated the rules of her tribe by falling in love with a\nman from another community. The couple was ordered to pay a fine of 25,000 rupees, upon the\nnon payment of which the village head ordered the woman to be raped. It, obviously and\nunderstandably, sent shock-waves across the country. But what few know is that such kangaroo\ncourts, known as \u2018shalishi adalats\u2019, operate in vast swathes of Bengal, especially its rural\nhinterland, and have even been known to hand out death sentences. And rarely have those handing\ndown such Talibanesque diktats been brought before the law. Some reported incidents of Brutality\nby Kangaroo Courts as reported in papers are-\n51See report by Sujoy Dhar dated January 23, 2014 \u201cWest Bengal woman says gang-raped on orders of\nPanchayat,\u201d available at http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/01/23/rape-panchayat-west-bengal-love-\nidINDEEA0M0AA20140123.\n37\nThe incident in Subalpur village in West Bengal\u2019s Birbhum district is shocking in its\nunimaginable brutality and points to a larger malaise. The order by a kangaroo court led by a\nvillage headman is proof that a section of rural India is outside the pale of the country\u2019s\nconstitutional values and judicial system. Ill-informed men with medieval social attitudes and\npatriarchal prejudices are allowed to adjudicate on the conduct and morality of women and pass\nunconscionable forms of punishment, such as social ostracism, payment of arbitrary fines and, as\nin this case, sexual violence in lieu of monetary penalty. The Supreme Court and the National\nCommission for Women have taken suo motu cognisance of the incident, which has caused\nwidespread outrage and revulsion.\nThe West Bengal government, which has been sharply criticised in recent times for\ncallousness and insensitivity towards crimes against women, has seen to it that the village\nheadman and the 12 men who raped the hapless woman for a whole night have been arrested. And\nChief Minister Mamata Banerjee, upset that the police did not seek custody of the accused for\nquestioning and allowed them to be sent to prison directly, ordered the suspension of the\nSuperintendent of Police. It is disturbing that the entire village, including women, backed the\nkangaroo court by whose verdict the man could get away with a fine, but the woman was punished\nfor not having the means to do so.\n2.6 SHALISHI ADALATS\nShalishi, a Bengali word of Persian origin, means mediation or arbitration. But what\nactually happens at these Adalats are a mockery of mediation. Though they are supposed to handle\nand resolve only petty civil disputes, these adalats pass judgement, and more often than not very\nflawed and biased ones, on a range of crimes ranging from thefts and extra-marital affairs to rape.\nIn most rape cases, the accused, especially if they come from relatively affluent or influential\nfamilies, get away with just small fines. Those who defy diktats have to pay a heavy price.\nAdultery, for instance, could attract anything from a death sentence to a fine of a few thousand\nrupees, while a petty thief could expect to be fined, flogged in public or even banished from the\nvillage. \u201cIt all depends on the financial and social status of the accused, the mood of the elders of\nthe village who are members of the shalishi court and their relationship with the accused or his or\nher family. If a woman from a well-to-do and influential household is accused of an extra-marital\n38\nrelationship, chances are she would be let off with a warning and a fine. But the same \u2018offence\u2019 by\na woman of a poor family would attract a much stiffer sentence, like being tonsured or paraded\nnaked around the village. If a person accused of, say, drunkenness, belongs to a family that\u2019s\naligned with an opposition party, the sentence would undoubtedly be more brutal. Debanjan\nMishra, a teacher of sociology at Calcutta University who has been documenting cases adjudged\nby shalishi courts over the past couple of years says \u201cA lot of factors come into play here, but it is\nalways those without political and financial clout who are subjected to the most ruthless sentences\nby these courts,\u201d\nThe death sentences imposed by the \u2018shalishi adalats\u2019 are usually executed in utmost\nsecrecy and the whole village takes an \u2018omerta\u2019 or oath of silence, thus foiling any effort by the\nlaw enforcement machinery to bring members of such kangaroo courts to justice. Even the bodies\nof the victims remain untraceable. In most cases, the \u2018shalishi adalats\u2019 are patronized by politicians\nand political parties. This is more so in the backward tribal belt where the village headmen and his\nhonchos pass diktats to vote for a particular political party and are, thus, sought after by the parties\nwho do not want to upset or anger them in any way. Very often, the \u2018shalishi adalats\u2019 are used by\nthe party in power to settle political scores over rivals.52\nBack in 2004, in a somewhat similar incident occurred in Bhawanipur village of\nMoradabad, Uttar Pradesh, the Khap had ordered turn-by-turn rape of a mother whose 20-year-old\nson eloped with a girl, the daughter of an influential Yadav family. The diktat was passed in order\nto save the honour of Yadavs since her son had dishonoured the Yadavs. The boy belonged to the\nbarber caste. \u201cNot only did they gang rape her, they burnt her alive to destroy any evidence. The\npolice knew about it but did nothing,\u201d said the uncle of the boy.53 Quite blatantly, the Khap\nbecomes a hindrance for the law enforcement agencies. In January 2014, a village Khap\nPanchayat of Muzaffarnagar has decided that it will not allow police to arrest those allegedly\ninvolved in five incidents of gang rape during last year's communal riots. The Special\nInvestigation Team, constituted by Uttar Pradesh government to probe into last year's\nMuzaffarnagar riots, had sent a list of 22 accused in five gang rape cases to the local police asking\n52See Jaidip Majumdar, \u201cThe Injustice of Justice,\u201d available at http://honourcrimes.wordpress.com/.\n53 See Khap panchayats Taliban? When will barbarism 'in the name of honour' end\u201d available at\nhttp://daily.bhaskar.com/article/CHD-Khap-panchayats-the-very-own-taliban-of-india-without-any-rein-\n4501055-NOR.html\n39\nthem to make the arrests. The arrest of one of the accused Vedpal on 24 January had triggered\nprotests by locals and Khap members. Police had met with resistance from irate locals when it had\ngone to the village to arrest the accused.\nIn India, despite repeated court directives to end the practice, the system of dispensing\n\u2018justice\u2019 through kangaroo courts continues in rural and urban places like Tamil Nadu, Haryana\netc. Interaction with leaders of political parties, activists of human rights organizations, lawyers\nand police officials reveal that the illegal system has its pervasive influence in almost all sectors\nand in rural and urban areas.\nBut what is the remedy to prevent these kangaroo courts that run parallel government. The\nlaw of the land has to extend its long arm to chase them away and keep a watch on their activities.\nAnywhere, any body passing individual judgments or threatening innocent people have to be\nbooked. The whole network of these kangaroo courts, have to be brought before the court to\nrestore a real democracy instead of the democracy followed now, which is a farce. Last but not the\nleast, the Government of India should remember its obligations and commitment to protect its\ncitizens from such violence under CEDWA.54\nIn Mushahari district in Bihar, a rape victim was offered Rs. 10,000 as compensation by\nthe village council and her family was threatened not to report the incidence to anyone. One can go\non with a list of such incidences which were ordered by village councils and dutifully carried out\nwithout a hint of shame or remorse. These village councils do not exercise any power to mete out\ncriminal punishment under any law and yet, there are frequent cases in which these councils not\nonly order gang rapes, illegal confinements and social boycotts, but go to the extent of ordering\nkillings, a phenomena which has come to be known as \u2018honour killings\u201955\nOutposts of feudalism still thrive in vast swathes of rural India, ranging from khap\nPanchayats in the north to caste-based gatherings of village elders in the south. In 2011,\nthe Supreme Court wanted illegal khap Panchayats that encourage \u2018honour killings\u2019 or other\ninstitutionalized atrocities to be stamped out ruthlessly. Over three years has elapsed since the\ncountry voiced its anger against sexual violence targeted at women and seemed to take a collective\n54 United Nation Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), 1981\n55 See Anshul Kumar Pandey, \u201cKangaroo Courts must go!,\u201d available at http://www.dnaindia.com/blogs/post-\nkangaroo-courts-must-go-1956917.\n40\nvow to ensure the protection of all women. The penal law on sexual violence and harassment has\nbeen strengthened significantly since then. Yet, India\u2019s cities and villages continue to be unsafe for\nwomen. The locus of sexual violence is everywhere: in public spaces and private homes, under the\ncloak of darkness and in the open, and perpetrated by well-acquainted persons as also as by\nstrangers. The Birbhum incident is a chilling reminder that legal processes, security measures and\nstringent laws are not enough. Social attitudes need to change, reflecting liberal and humane\nvalues, if the country is to ensure gender equality and protection for all its women.56\n56 See report in The Hindu dated 25th January 2014, \u201cStamp out kangaroo courts.\u201d\n41\nChapter -3\nKHAP PANCHAYAT, KANGAROO COURT AND THE STATE\n3.1 INTRODUCTION\nThe State, in the Weberian sense, can be defined as a set of institutions that monopolize the\nlegitimate use of force and rule making within a given territory. Monopolization of physical force\nis the very foundation on which the very existence of State rests. Such monopolization endows the\nState with power to make authoritative binding decisions and to perform other functions. Without\nsuch power, a State cannot be said to be effective. A democratic State like India, banks on the\nsmooth functioning of the three organs of State i.e., the Legislature, the Judiciary and the\nExecutive. The three organs of the State work in tandem according to the principles of natural\njustice and rule of law. Kangaroo courts be they in the form of khap Panchayats or Shailishi\nadalats, which are without any doubt extremely influential in the areas they exist, by their bizarre\ndiktats which seemingly possess a lot of social sanction and approval of the masses, question the\neffectiveness of the State with brazen impudence.\nSo strong is the influence of these Panchayats and qusi judicial bodies among villagers and\nsometimes even among educated class alike that the State machinery most of the times fails to\nrespond timely to their unfair diktats which are nothing but pure mockery of rules of natural\njustice. Be it the ordering of gang-rape of women for having an affair with a man of higher caste or\nthe banning of mobile phone use by young girls, the impact of diktats of kangaroo courts is\nprofound on the geographical areas where they exist.\nThe political class for the fear of losing their votebanks, try their best to ignore the\ninhuman diktats which shock the very conscience of any civilized human being. What makes the\n42\nKhap Panchayat so powerful is that every Khap rules over eighty-four villages, turning them into\nleaders of powerful votebanks which are capable of controlling power play of numbers at the time\nof elections. Khap Panchayats grasp on the lives of the people is an indicator towards the States\u2019\ninability or unwillingness interventionist role in these affairs.\nAlthough there are various reasons which can be attributed to the overwhelming hold of\nkhaps on the masses57 but most importantly it is the absence of the State interference that has\nfurther emboldened such Panchayats to mete out their brand of capricious justice. Surprisingly, the\nrural population supports the Panchayats\u2019 inhuman decisions and it is because of such support that\nit is claimed by the Panchayats that their decisions essentially fall under the \u2018private sphere\u2019 of the\nvillage unit. There is also seen a reluctance on the part of the police and investigating agencies\nwhile pursuing the crimes committed in the name of honour.58 We need to see whether the State\ndoes recede completely from the supposed \u2018private\u2019 sphere, especially when such a retreat has\nimperiled several innocent young lives. When a life is taken or a body of a woman ravished, can\nthe State shirk its responsibility and watch the horrors of crime being committed as a dumb and\ndeaf spectator?\nIn this chapter we would analyze the role which the State organs play when faced with barbaric\ndiktats against women are being justified in the name of tradition, honour and culture.\n3.2 KHAPS AND THE JUDICIARY\nThe beauty and strength of Indian judiciary lies in the impact it creates in the lives of\ncommon people. Where the Legislature because of whatsoever reasons is not able to curb a social\nmenace, the Judiciary comes to play its role and acts as the strong upholder of human rights. The\nevils of kangaroo style courts have also not escaped the eye of the vigilant Supreme Court and the\njudicial system, realizing the extent and frequencies of the malpractices and atrocities inflicted by\n57 Some of the reasons for dominance/overpowering of Khap Panchayats/shaileshi adalats are- Weakness of the\nelected Panchayati Raj Institutions, political failure, judicial delays and distrust of system, socio economic\nfactors. For details See chapter - 2 of this Report\n58 The Manoj Babli case being the most blatant example of the laxity on the part of the investigating agencies in\npreventing dishonor crimes. See infra 3.1.\n43\nmedieval alleged Taliban-styled caste courts, has by its interference, tried to, some extent, put\nbrakes on their working.\nWe have already discussed that khaps, and shalishi adalats are self-appointed or at worst\nmob-operated tribunals that function with complete disregard to existing principles of law or\nhuman rights, especially one in a frontier area or among criminals in prison. It is a crudely or\nirregularly operated court, i.e. one so biasedly controlled so as to render a fair trial impossible. A\nkangaroo court or kangaroo trial, is in reality a sham legal proceeding or court. That is why the\nterm \u201ckangaroo court\u201d is used to describe judicial proceedings that deny due process rights in the\nname of expediency. Such rights include, the right to summon witnesses, the right of cross-\nexamination, the right not to incriminate oneself, the right not to be tried on secret evidence, the\nright to control one\u2019s own defence, the right to exclude evidence that is improperly obtained,\nirrelevant or inherently inadmissible, e.g., hearsay, the right to exclude judges or jurors on the\ngrounds of partiality or conflict of interest, and most importantly the right of appeal.\nSince there is no right to appeal, the verdict of the khap/shalishi Adalat is virtually\nunchallenged and the power yielded by the heads of such kangaroo courts unchecked and\nuncontrolled. Laxity on the part of law enforcement further emboldens them and they continue\nwith their illegitimate and inhuman dispensing of so called \u201cjustice.\u201d The atrocities of the kangaroo\ncourts in the name of honour and tradition have not gone unnoticed by the eyes of higher judiciary.\nIn Smt. Laxmi Kahhwaha v. The State of Rajasthan,59 a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed in\nthe Rajasthan High Court, drawing the attention of the court to illegal regimes of caste Panchayats\non the weaker section of the society, especially on women. The court observed that these\nPanchayats had no jurisdiction whatsoever to pass social boycott, or impose any fine on anyone\nand to violate the basic rights of an individual.\nOn the menace of honour killings, the Supreme Court has time and again reiterated the\nbarbaric offences committed in the name of honour cannot be allowed to go unpunished. In Lata\nSingh v. State of UP and Another,60 the apex court observed: \u201cWe sometimes hear of \u2018honour\u2019\nkillings of such persons who undergo inter-caste or inter-religious marriage of their own free will.\nThere is nothing honourable in such killings, and in fact they are nothing but barbaric and shameful\n59 AIR 1999 Raj 254.\n60 AIR 2006 SC 2522.\n44\nacts of murder committed by brutal, feudal minded persons who deserve harsh punishment. Only in\nthis way can we stamp out such acts of barbarism. The police at all the concerned places should\nensure that neither the petitioner nor her husband nor any relatives of the petitioner\u2019s husband are\nharassed or threatened nor any acts of violence are committed against them. If anybody is found\ndoing so, he should be proceeded against sternly in accordance with law, by the authorities\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Supreme Court in Arumugam Servai & Others. v. State of Tamil Nadu,61 observed-\n\u201cWe have in recent years heard of `Khap Panchayats\u2019 (known as Katta Panchayats in Tamil\nNadu) which often decree or encourage honour killings or other atrocities in an\ninstitutionalized way on boys and girls of different castes and religion, who wish to get\nmarried or have been married, or interfere with the personal lives of people. We are of the\nopinion that this is wholly illegal and has to be ruthlessly stamped out. There is nothing\nhonourable in honour killing or other atrocities against women and, in fact, it is nothing but\nbarbaric and shameful murder. Other atrocities against women in respect of personal lives\nof people committed by brutal, feudal minded persons deserve harsh punishment. Only in\nthis way can we stamp out such acts of barbarism and feudal mentality.\u201d\nThe Court declaring such kangaroo styled courts to be illegitimate, further directed the\nadministration to tackle with them strictly. The court held-\n\u201cMoreover, these acts take the law into their own hands, and amount to kangaroo\ncourts, which are wholly illegal. Hence, we direct the administrative and police\nofficials to take strong measures to prevent such atrocious acts. If any such incidents\nhappen, apart from instituting criminal proceedings against those responsible for\nsuch atrocities, the State Government is directed to immediately suspend the District\nMagistrate/Collector and SSP/SPs of the district as well as other officials concerned\nand charge sheet them and proceed against them departmentally if they do not (1)\nprevent the incident or if it has not already occurred but they have knowledge of it\nin advance, or (2) if it has occurred, they do not promptly apprehend the culprits and\n61 2011 (2) SCC 405.\n45\nothers involved and institute criminal proceedings against them, as in our opinion\nthey will be deemed to be directly or indirectly accountable in this connection62.\u201d\nThis judgment has not gone down very well with the Khaps. Again the Supreme Court in\nBhagwan Dass v. State of NCT, Delhi,63 laid down that the honour killing satisfies \u2018the rarest of the\nrare\u2019 doctrine so as to attract the death penalty for its perpetrators. In the above decision the Indian\nSupreme Court held that in cases of \u2018honour\u2019 killing there must be a mandatory death sentence for\nthe perpetrators of such crimes, and the police and administrative officials who did not prevent\nthem must be immediately suspended. This decision raised a hue and cry among the caste\norganizations, but has been widely acclaimed by the enlightened section of Indian society.\nAgain in State of UP v. Krishna Master64 the Supreme Court awarded life sentence to the\nthree accused of the honour killing who murdered six persons of a family. The Bench further\nobserved that wiping out almost entire family on the flimsy ground of saving the honour of the\nfamily would fall within rarest of the rare cases evolved by this court.\nIn Faiz Ahmed Ahanger and Ors. v. State of J & K,65 the Supreme Court very clearly laid\ndown the right of the couple getting married out of their own wish to seek police protection in case\nthey fear violence on the part of the families. The court held that:\n\u201cIn such cases of inter-caste or inter religion marriage the Court has only to be satisfied\nabout two things: (1) That the girl is above 18 years of age, in which case, the law regards\nher as a major vide Section 3 of the Indian Majority Act, 1875. A major person is deemed\nby the law to know what is in his or her welfare. (2) The wish of the girl.\u201d The court then\ndirected that \u201cin the circumstances, we direct that nobody will harass, threaten or commit\nany acts of violence or other unlawful act on the petitioner, Chanchali Devi / Mehvesh\nAnjum and the petitioner\u2019 family members and they shall not be arrested till further orders\nin connection with the case in question. If they feel insecure, they can apply to the police\nand, in such event, the police shall grant protection to them.\u201d\n62 Ibid.\n63 2011(5) Scale 498.\n64 AIR 2010 SC 3071.\n65 2009 (3) R.A.J. 692.\n46\nIt is also interesting to note the observation of the Delhi High Court in Vivek Kumar @\nSanju v. The State,66 wherein the Hon\u2019ble court held-\n\u201cThere is no law which prohibits a girl under 18 years from falling in love with someone\nelse. Neither falling in love with somebody is an offence under IPC or any other penal law.\nDesiring to marry her love is also not an offence. A young girl, who is in love has two\ncourses available to her \u2013 one is that she should marry with the consent of her parents after\nobtaining the consent of her parents. If her parents do not agree to persuade them or to wait\nfor attaining the age of majority and then exercise her right as a major to marry the person\nof her own choice. However, this is possible only when the house of her parents where she\nis living has congenial atmosphere and she is allowed to live in peace in that house and wait\nfor attaining age of majority.\u201d\nThe court further held that\n\u201cRight to life and liberty as guaranteed by the Constitution is equally available to minors. A\nfather has no right to forcibly marry off her daughter, who is below 18 years against her\nwishes. Neither he has right to kill her, because she intends to marry out of her religion. If\na girl around 17 years of age runs away from her parents house to save herself from the\nonslaught of her father or relatives and joins her lover or runs away with him, it is no\noffence either on the part of girl or on the part of boy with whom she ran away and\nmarried.\u201d\nThe Delhi High Court also emphatically pointed out that the \u201cscenario in this country in\nsome regions or families in respect of out caste marriages and marriages in different religions is\nsufficient to create fear in the mind of a young girl whose parents rebuke her and tell her that she\nwill be killed if she insists upon marrying her love because the person is not of the same religion or\nsame caste. If such a girl leaves the house, the reason behind her leaving of the house cannot be\nenticing away by somebody but it is driving her away from home by her father.\u201d\n66 Crl.M.C. No. 3073-74/2006 decided on 23.2.2007.\n47\nIn the infamous Manoj Babli case,67 the Punjab and Haryana High Court while giving the\njudgment on the murder reference remarked- \u201cEven in the 21st century such a shameful act of\nhollow honor killing is perpetrated in our society. We feel that it is really a slur on the fine fabric\nof the Indian society. Abduction is really cruel and that too murder of the abductees is barbaric.\"\nThe court admitted its predicament in deciding the case said-\u201cunfortunately in this case there is no\neye witness to the occurrence. The entire case of the prosecution depends on the circumstantial\nevidence. The court was left with the option of inferring certain facts from the circumstances\nprojected by the prosecution. As we have rendered the verdict based on the circumstantial\nevidence, our conscious does not permit us to confirm the death sentence awarded to the accused..\u201d\nThe Punjab & Haryana High Court\u2019s comments at the end of the judgment on the apathy\nand laxity of the investigating agency in collecting evidence is an example of the deliberate failure\non the part of law enforcement agencies which in this case is the police in protecting the young\ncouples from the menace of dishonour killings. The court observed-\n\u201cOn a careful perusal of the entire process of investigation embarked upon by the\ninvestigating officials, we find that they had just investigated the matter for the purpose of\ngiving disposal to the investigation. They have not evinced any interest as warranted in this\ncase, to collect telling materials as against the accused in a crime which has virtually\nthrown a challenge to the society itself. A team of the Police officials should have been\nemployed considering the gravity of the offence to collect fool-proof evidence but quite\nunfortunately novices in the investigation field have been employed to detect the shocking\ncrime for the reasons best known.\u201d\nThe NGO Shakti Vahini had filed a writ petition68in the Supreme Court seeking to ban\nPanchayats, especially Khaps on the plea that they are the cause for \u201chonour killings and that\nthat they are working as \u201cextra judicial\u201d bodies. While hearing the petition Supreme Court said\nit was an offence to order women not to use mobile phones or to dress in a particular manner\nand warned that no one can run a parallel matrimony court to issue diktats against the law to\nharass young couples. The court observed, \u201cImposing a dress code on women and asking them\n67 Murder Reference No. 2 of 2010 Criminal Appeal No.479-DB of 2010 and Criminal revision No. 2173 of\n2010.\n68 (Civil) number 231/2010\n48\nnot to use mobile phones are such orders not socially retrograde. But these are also against the\nlaw. How can anyone ask women not to carry a mobile phone.\u201d\nThe Hon\u2019ble Court, while hearing the petition also questioned the inspector general of police\nadditional, director general (law and order) along with superintendents of police of on khap-\ndictated honour killings. All the police officers said, khaps sometimes adopt socially retrograde\nresolutions but there had been no instance of their members being involved in honour killings. The\npolice said it was the family members who indulged in killings of youth who defy caste and gotra\nbarriers. The bench found it surprising as to why the police of UP and Haryana were \u201cso anxious to\ngive a good conduct certificate\u201d to the khaps. The additional advocates general of both States had\nsought time to file a proper affidavit on behalf of the police.\nSince the filing of the petition by Shakti Vahini in 2010, the court had been conducting the\nproceedings in absence of any representation from the khaps. Realizing this, the court by order\ndated January 14, 2013 asked for representation of khaps to hear their response to the petition.\nKhaps response to the court is being discussed in part 3.3 of this chapter. The verdict of the PIL is\nstill awaited.\n3.3 KHAPS AND THE LEGISLATURE\nUntil the Prohibition of Unlawful Assembly (Interference with the Freedom of Matrimonial\nAlliance) Bill, 2011 is passed and comes into force, there is essentially no legal framework created\nto counter the menace of honour killings prevalent in North India (Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and\nHaryana). There are no specific laws to deal with honour killings and an honour killing is just\nanother offence which is to be dealt with under the Indian Penal Code, 1872.\n49\nIn absence of specific offence in the IPC, honour killings would be treated as murder they\nfall under the category of section 300 of Indian Penal Code 1860.69 Clause fourth of Sec 300 IPC\nspecifies that if the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it\nmust, in all probability, cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits\nsuch act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such bodily injury as\naforesaid commits the offence of murder. This very explanation covers the act of killings which are\ndone for honour. Here the act is intentional, imminently dangerous and in all probability has the\nchances of causing death, so it will not be improper to say that the culprits involved in honour\nkillings should be punished as the murderers and capital punishment should be imposed on them.\nThe Uttar Pradesh government submitted in its affidavit that \u201cThere was no specific legal\nframework to address the problem of honour killings but the Director General of Police and\nadditional DGP have issued directions to ensure compliance with the provisions of Protection of\nWomen from Domestic Violence Act, 2005.\u201d The State of Rajasthan relied on two circulars, one\nissued in 2001 and another in 2006, to check activities of caste Panchayats. Haryana, on the other\nhand, said it had put in place an action plan to combat honour killings. This information was\ncollated by amicus curiae Raju Ramachandran from the affidavits filed by the States in response to\na PIL by NGO Shakti Vahini seeking the apex court\u2019s intervention to protect couples, who were\nforced to annul their inter-caste marriages or killed for defiance. The Centre said it was actively\nplanning to amend the Indian Penal Code to make honour killing a specific offence.70\nWhy it is important to have a separate offence for dishonor killings is highlighted by the\nManoj-Babli case.71 The Trial court sentenced to death five men who dragged out the young couple\nManoj-Babli from a crowded bus and killed them for marrying against the wishes of their\ncommunity in rural Haryana. Additional District and Sessions Judge taking a strict stand against\nthe traditional caste-based 'khap Panchayats', one of which had come out against the May 2007\n69 Section 300 Murder -Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder,\nFirstly, if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or\u2014\nSecondly.\u2014If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to\ncause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused, or\u2014\nThirdly.\u2014If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to\nbe inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or\u2014\nFourthly.\u2014If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all\nprobability, cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any\nexcuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid.\n70See report by Dhananjay Mahapatra, \u201cNo Law in Place to rein In Khaps; the Supreme Court of India,the\nTimes of India, dated July 19, 2012.\n71 See supra note 10.\n50\nmarriage of Manoj and Babli, sentenced to death the culprits which included Babli's brother\nSuresh, uncles Rajinder and Baru Ram, and cousins Gurdev and Satish. 'Khap Panchayat' leader\nGanga Raj, who too was convicted for murder along with the five, was given life imprisonment.\nMandeep Singh, a driver accused of abducting the couple, got seven years in jail.\nThe Couple had married in May 2007 after falling in love but the Panchayat of the area\ndeclared their relationship as void. Just a month after the marriage, their relatives dragged them out\nof a bus and murdered them. Later, they dumped their bodies in an irrigation canal.72 The High\nCourt however on appeal converted the death sentence to life imprisonment due to lack of direct\nevidence. The High Court observed that- \u201cAs we have rendered the verdict based on the\ncircumstantial evidence, our conscious does not permit us to confirm the death sentence awarded to\nthe accused.\u201d The court convicted the offenders for the offence under Section 302 IPC sentenced\nthem each life imprisonment. Adding that they shall not released unless each of them completes 20\nyears of actual imprisonment sans remission. They were also ordered to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/-\neach failing which they shall further undergo RI for a period of six months each.\nHad honour killing been a specific offence under a special law, such a situation would not\nhave arisen, and the High Court would not have been forced to reduce the punishment from death\npenalty to life imprisonment. Former CJI P. Sathasivam also favours a special law to combat\nHonour Killings. In this regard he stated,\n\u201cA special legislation will certainly be a welcome effort as it will help in generating additional\nprotection to the victims. Though the prevailing law punishes the act of homicide, it does not\ndirectly punish the members gathering for such purpose.\u201d\nThe stringent provisions of the proposed Bill coupled with those in the IPC would\neffectively combat honour killings and protect the helpless young couples and their families who\nare the victims of this social evil.73\nAmicus curie Raju Ramachandran\u2019s report74 keeping in view the legislative vacuum\nexisting for the purpose of countering Khap Panchayats and honour killings dictated by them\nasserted that it would be appropriate for the Supreme Court to give appropriate directions to\n72 Ibid.\n73 Special law will deter honour killings, says Sathasivam, The Hindu, dated 30th June, 2013.\n74 In Shakti Vahini case.\n51\nprevent atrocities in the name of honour and tradition. He further suggested that the States must be\ndirected to immediately identify areas, where Khaps are active and the police officers in charge of\nthese areas must take every step possible to protect any inter-caste marriages, including protection\nto the threatened couple. The amicus also said that the police must act in advance and prevent\nKhap Panchayat meetings aimed at taking decisions against couples in the name of honour and if\nrequired arrest key members to foil the gatherings.\nThe National Commission for Women in 2010 drafted a Bill titled \u201cPrevention of Crimes in\nthe name of Honour and Tradition\u201d suggesting certain prohibitive and penal measures to curb the\nspate of murders and dishonourable crimes in the name of \u2018honour.\u2019 The bill very categorically\naffirms every individuals right to choose partner whether in marriage or otherwise. Clause 3 of the\nbill reads- \u201cAll persons including young persons and women have the right to control their own\nlives, a right to liberty and freedom of expression, and a right of association, movement and bodily\nintegrity. They have a right to choose their own partners in marriage or otherwise and any action to\nprevent the exercise of these rights shall amount to an offence under the provisions of this Bill.\u201d\nthus any attempt in preventing a life partner of one\u2019s choice would be an offence under the act.\nThe Bill penalises any killing in the name of honour by punishment prescribed in the IPC.75\nIt also penalised the harassing of any woman or her partner in order to prevent them exercising\ntheir right to marry out of their own choice.76 The bill makes both physical and mental acts of\nharassment punishable and describes the acts of harassment with meticulous details.\n75 Clause 4 reads: If any person or persons, whether he or they are members of the victims family or person or\npersons acting in concert with , or, at the behest of, a member of the family or a member of a body or group of\nthe caste or clan or community or caste panchayat ( by whatever name called), kills or kill , a woman or her\npartner( or any person/persons associating with her or them) causes grievous hurt or any form of injury or to\npersecute her or them for exercising the rights Stated in Section 1, or participates or incites such an act , shall\nbe guilty of murder or any offence and shall be punishable with the punishment prescribed in the Indian Penal\nCode,1860.\nExplanation I \u2013 For the purpose of this section, all members of the caste or clan or community or caste\npanchayat, present or participates\nor incites the commission of an act by which death is caused was ordered, shall be deemed to be guilty of\nhaving committed such act.\n76 Clause 5 reads- If any person or persons, whether he or they are members of the victims family or person or\npersons acting in concert with, or, at the behest of, a member of the family or a member of a body or group of\nthe caste or clan or community or caste panchayat ( by whatever name called) harasses or harass a woman or\nher partner (or anyone connected with them) for exercising the rights in Section 1 or attempts/attempt to\nprevent either one or both of them from exercising these rights they shall be punished with imprisonment for a\nminimum term of one year and a maximum term of ten years and shall also be liable for punitive fine.\n52\nExplanation I of clause 5 reads- The acts of harassment and prevention in this Section shall include\nboth physical and mental acts such as-\ni. Declaring the couple, who have got married, a brother and sister, provided that they are\nnot children from the same natural parent and such marriages are recognised by any law or\ncustom for the time being in force.\nii. Extraditing the couple or their family or relatives from the village or area they live in,\niii. Asking the couple or anyone associated with them or harbouring them to pay a fine,\niv. Imposing social sanctions or social boycott on the couple or their family or anyone\nassociated with them,\nv. Imposing economic sanctions or boycott on the couple or their family associated with\nthem,\nvi. Divesting the couple or their family including the family of the male partner of any land\nor property belonging to them,\nvii. Repeatedly harassing the couple or either of them not to meet or associate with or live\nwith each other, by physically visiting them or through any means of communication,\nviii. Threatening the couple or either of them or their family or anyone associated with\nthem of retributive action of any kind whatsoever,\nix. Causing harm or injury to the girl or the couple or anyone connected with them.\nx. Any other act or acts of harassment or intimidation, whether physical or mental or\npsychological, to stop the couple or either of them from meeting or being in the company of\neach other.\nA mere endorsement of killings or of harassment by anyone in public is a punishable\noffence under the bill.77\nThe bill also shifted the burden of proving where any person or persons is or are prosecuted\nfor an offence under the bill, on the person/persons so accused that he or they have not committed\nthe offence or offences.78\n77 Clause 6 reads- If any person or persons, including a body of persons by whatever name it is called, eulogises\nor publicly supports or incites, the harassment or killing or any kind of violence against the couple or either of\nthem or any member of their family, he or they shall be punishable with a term of imprisonment upto two years\nand with punitive fine.\n78 Clause 7\n53\nThe power to prohibit certain acts under the act is on the Collector or the District Magistrate.\nClause 8 reads-\n(1) Where the Collector or the District Magistrate is of the opinion or has received\ninformation that any of the offences under Sections 4, 5 or 6 are likely to be committed, he\nshall by order prohibit/prevent the commission of such offences and further prohibit the\nmeeting of any persons or body of persons likely to discuss the commission of the said\noffences.\n(2) Whoever contravenes any order made under Sub-Section (1) shall be punishable with\nimprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six months but may extend to two\nyears and with fine.\n3) When an Executive Magistrate receives information that any person or persons acting in\nconcert with , or, at the behest of, a member of the family or a member of a body or group\nof the caste or clan or community or caste panchayat ( by whatever name called), is likely\nto commit any wrongful and is of opinion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding, he\nmay in the manner hereinafter provided, require such person or persons acting in concert\nwith , or, at the behest of, a member of the family or a member of a body or group of the\ncaste or clan or community or caste panchayat ( by whatever name called),to show cause\nwhy he/they should not be ordered to execute a bond with sureties for keeping peace and\nmaintain good conduct for such period, not exceeding one year, as the Magistrate thinks fit.\nProceeding under this section may be taken before any Executive Magistrate when either\nthe place where the breach of the peace or disturbance is apprehended is within his local\njurisdiction or there is within such jurisdiction a person who is likely to commit a breach of\nthe peace or disturb the public tranquillity or to do any wrongful act as aforesaid beyond\nsuch jurisdiction.\nWhen a Magistrate acting under this provision, deems it necessary to require any person to\nshow cause under such section he shall make an order in writing, setting forth the substance\nof the information received, the amount of the bond to be executed, the term for which it is\nto be in force, and the number, character and class of sureties (if any) required.\n54\nThe bill interestingly makes a provision for the desirous couple to notify about their\nintention to marry to government officials.79 However, the provision falls short of providing any\nsort of protection to the couples who notify government officials of their intention to marry as there\nis no mandatory duty cast on such an official so notified to protect the couple. Clause 10 the bill\nalso casts obligation on certain persons to report about commission of the offences under this Bill80\nThe provisions of this Bill shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of the provisions of any\nother law, for the time being in force.81\nThe draft bill proposed by NCW was a welcome step trying to curb the growing criminal\nactivities done in the garb of honour, however, as pointed out rightly in the report of the Law\ncommission,82 it missed the necessity and desirability of the focus on directly dealing with\nunlawful assemblies and their vicious influences. Thus, the law commission came up with the\nproposed piece of legislation, the \u201cProhibition of Unlawful Assembly (Interference with the\nFreedom of Matrimonial Alliance) Bill, 2011\u201d with major focus on unlawful assemblies which\naccording to the Law commission gathered on caste/community lines assume to themselves the\npower and authority to declare on and deal with \u2018objectionable\u2019 matrimonies and exhibit least\nregard for life and liberty and are not deterred by the processes of administration of justice. Such\nassemblies harass and victimize innocent youth and continue to wield unhindered authority and\nalso seem to resist any suggestion of being subjected to any social control.\nLaw commission also points out how the unlawful assembly as defined in the bill is\ndifferent from unlawful assembly defined in section 141 of the Indian Penal Code. The proposed\nlaw intends to deal with the conduct of local bodies or caste assemblies and to strike at the blind\n79 Clause 9 of the bill reads- Declaration by a Couple of intention to be together- Any two persons desirous of\nmarrying each other, or associating with each other shall be entitled to declare their age and willingness to be\ntogether, in oral or in writing, before any Government official who shall send the said information to the\nnearest Police Station and no action shall be taken by the Police and or any other authority or at the instance of\nthird party, against the said couple.\n80 Clause 10 of the bill reads-\u2013 (1) All officers of the Government are hereby required and empowered to assist\nthe police in the execution of the provisions of this Bill or any rule or order made there under.\n(2) All village officers and such other officers as may be specified by the Collector or the District Magistrate in\nrelation to any area and the inhabitants of such area shall, if they have reason to believe or have the knowledge\nthat any of the offences mentioned under Sections 4, 5 or 6 is are about to be, or have been committed in the\narea they shall forthwith report such fact to the nearest police station.\n(3) Whoever contravenes the provisions of sub-section (1) or subsection (2) shall be punishable with\nimprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years and shall also be liable to fine.\n81 Clause 11.\n82 Report No. 242 on the Prevention of Interference with the Freedom of Matrimonial Alliances (in the name of\nHonour and Tradition): A Suggested Legal Framework.\n55\nfury of such associations acting in disregard of liberty of persons. A special class of unlawful\nassembly with a different punishment is, therefore, suggested as a measure of greater efficacy. In\nany case the provisions of the bill are not in derogation / contrary of IPC but in addition to it.\nThe Commission rejected the proposal to amend Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code to\ninclude \u2018honour killings\u2019 within the definition of murder on the ground that the existing provisions\nare adequate to take care of the situations leading to overt acts of killing or causing bodily harm to\nthe targeted person who allegedly undermined the honour of the caste or community. The motive\nbehind killing a person does not furnish real justification to introduce a separate provision in\nsection 300. Further, shifting the onus on to the accused facing accusations of involvement in the\nserious offence of murder etc. or abetment thereof is not desirable. Such a move will be against the\ncardinal principles of jurisprudence accepted and absorbed into our criminal justice system. If\nburden of proof has to be shifted in such a case, logically, it will have to be done in a large number\nof other heinous crimes.\nThe Prohibition of Unlawful Assembly (Interference with the Freedom of Matrimonial\nAlliances) Bill, 2011 proposes by clause 2(1) that no person or any group of persons shall gather\nwith an \u201cintention to deliberate on, or condemn any marriage, not prohibited by law, on the basis\nthat such marriage has dishonoured the caste or community tradition or brought disrepute to all or\nany of the persons forming part of the assembly or the family or the people of the locality\nconcerned.\u201d The explanation to the clause includes a proposed or intended marriage within the\nterm \u2018Marriage.\u2019\nClause 2(2) directs any such gathering or assembly or congregation to be treated as an\nunlawful assembly and every person convening or organizing such assembly and every member\nthereof participating to be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than six months but\nwhich may be extend to one year and shall also be liable to fine up to ten thousand rupees.\nBy virtue of clause 4 of the bill any member of an unlawful assembly who alone or in\nassociation with other such members counsels, exhorts or brings pressure upon any person or\npersons so as to prevent, or disapprove of the marriage which is objected to by the said members of\nthe unlawful assembly, or creates an environment of hostility towards such couple or either of them\nor their relatives or supporters, shall be deemed to have acted in endangerment of their liberty and\nsuch an act of endangerment shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term of not less than one\n56\nyear but which may extend to two years and shall also be liable to fine up to twenty thousand\nrupees.\nClause 4 (1) penalises criminal intimidation of the couple or their relatives. The clause\nreads- \u201cany member of an unlawful assembly who, with a view to secure compliance with the\nillegal decision of that assembly in relation to the marriage that is being objected to, indulges in\ncriminal intimidation of the couple or either of them or their relatives or supporters shall be\npunishable with imprisonment for a term of not less than one year but which may extend to three\nyears and shall also be liable to fine up to thirty thousand rupees provided that if the threat be to\ncause harm or injury of the description referred to in second part of Section 506 IPC, the maximum\npunishment shall extend to seven years of imprisonment instead of three years and fine extending\nto thirty thousand rupees.\u201d\nThe explanation to the clause clarifies that Criminal intimidation means the same as section\n506, Indian Penal Code 1860.\nThe bill further tightens the noose on persons participating in the assembly by presuming\nhis intention to commit the act. The clause 6 of the proposed bill reads- \u201cIn a prosecution under\nsection 3 or section 4, if it is found that any accused person participated or continued to participate\nin an unlawful assembly, the Court shall presume that he intended and decided to take all necessary\nsteps to put into effect the decision of unlawful assembly including the commission of acts referred\nto in Sections 3 and 4.\u201d\nThe Collector or the District Magistrate has been entrusted with the responsibility of\nensuring the safety of the persons targeted in case any decision is taken by the khap Panchayat and\nhe/she shall take necessary steps to prohibit the convening of such illegal gatherings.83 Any\nviolation of any provision of the proposed law will attract imprisonment up to three years and a\nfine of up to Rs 30,000.\n83 clause 8. (1) Where the Collector or District Magistrate receives information that there is a likelihood of\nconvening of an unlawful assembly, he shall, by order, prohibit the convening of any such assembly and doing\nof any act towards the commission of any offence under this Act by any person in any area specified in the\norder.\n(2) The Collector or District Magistrate may take such steps as may be necessary to give effect to such order,\nincluding giving of appropriate directives to the police authorities.\n(3) The Collector or District Magistrate shall also take such steps as may be necessary to ensure the safety of\nthe persons targeted pursuant to the illegal decision taken by the unlawful assembly.\n57\nThe cases are to be tried in Special Courts presided over by a Sessions Judge or Additional\nSessions Judge.84 The Special Court would be empowered to suo motu cognizance of the cases.85\nAll offences under the proposed Act will be cognizable, non-bailable and non-compoundable.86\nThe basic intention behind the proposed piece of legislation is to secure freedom of choice\nand right to family of the individual and to deal with mischief created by unlawful assemblies that\nthreaten an individuals\u2019 freedom of choice to matrimony. The law commissions\u2019 endeavor is\ncommendable however, it is not flawless. Any potential act that comes beyond the Khap type for\nexample the family of the victim is left unaddressed. However, since the proposed law is only in\naddition to the existing criminal law, any homicide or act of criminal intimidation by the members\nof the family can be easily covered under the IPC.\nThe root cause of the problem lies in the mindset of people which the bill fails to address\ncompletely. The solution offered in the Bill is criminalization and as experiences have shown,\ncriminalization might be not be that successful to bring remedies.\nIt has been suggested by the NUJS in its analysis of the bill that the word \u2018marriage\u2019\nshould also be enlarged to include live in relationships and the like, keeping in view the changing\nmores of the society and in consonance with the Supreme Courts legitimizing live-in relationships\nin certain cases. Keeping in mind the ground realities of the societies in which khaps function and\nyield power, such an inclusion of \u201clive-in\u201d relationships within the ambit of \u201cmarriage\u201d would only\nfurther alienate the rural masses from the law makers and would defeat the whole purpose by\ninciting anti-law sentiment in the rural heartland, who take pride in sticking to their age old\ncustoms. May be once the rural society reaches that point when sagotra marriages or inter caste\nmarriages become acceptable, we can think of including \u201clive-ins\u201d into the ambit of \u201cmarriage.\u201d\n84 Clause 9. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, all offences under this\nAct shall be triable by a Special Court constituted under a notification issued in the official gazette and the\nspecial court shall be presided over by an officer of the rank of Sessions Judge or Addl. Sessions Judge.\n(2) The State Government shall in consultation with the High Court constitute one or more Special Courts for\nthe trial of offences under this Act and every Special Court shall exercise jurisdiction in respect of the whole or\nsuch part of the State as may be specified in the notification.\n85 Clause 10. (1) A Special Court may take cognizance of any offence, without the accused being committed to\nit for trial, upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute such offence, or upon a police report of such\nfacts.\n86 Clause 12. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, all offences under this\nAct shall be cognizable, non- bailable and non -compoundable.\n58\nThe prohibited action in section 2 is \"gather assemble or congregate at any time with a view\nor intention \u2026\u201d This seems to suggest only gathering/assembly/congregation in the physical space.\nThe section should also take into consideration the technological advancement and include virtual\nparticipation through social networks and the like. It should cover both direct and indirect\nparticipation. The action intended in section 2 may not always be collective action. As mentioned\nin the general observation above, if intimidation, threat or coercion can occur from within\nfamily/or one of the member of the family. Such act need not always be to break marriages but\ncould also be to coerce someone into marriage. Therefore, under the prohibited action in section 2,\nsuch acts should also figure in.\nClause 6 uses the word \u2018participation\u2019 which should be defined to mean not only physical\npresence but also political, financial and other influences. With the increase in occurrence of\nphenomenon of flash mobs due to increasing mobile phone and internet use, there has to be a room\nmade for virtual participation.\nJust like the bill proposed by NCW, the LCI\u2019s Bill also does not include punishments for\nomission on part of the authority, which receives information about the said offenses but fails to\ntake appropriate action. Addition of accountability on the part of responsible office/officers in the\nsection has to be considered to make the law effective and implementable.\nA NCW Member, Smt.Shamina Shafiq, who visited the residences of the couple who was\nlynched by the girls family, spoke to their family members, relatives and friends. The young couple\nwas killed by girls family because they both belonged to same gotra and the same village. While\nspeaking to media persons after visiting boys family, she said \"They told me that they have decided\nnot to pursue this case legally, as they fear a social boycott. We will try to speak with women who\nare not related to this case.\" She further said.\n\"A kind of above the law social structure has been created and people are punishing\npeople by killing them. This needs to be strongly condemned. It is the responsibility of the police\nand other authorities that such an incident is not repeated.\"\n59\nSlamming khap Panchayats justify honour killings on the plea of seeking an amendment in\nthe Hindu Marriage Act 1955,87 \"They want to say that an amendment in law will stop such\nmurders? Does this mean that you are trying to scare us that if you marry in the same gotra, we will\ncontinue to kill people? This is no justification. When and what kind of amendment will be done in\nthe law, this is a legal issue...\"\nShe took a dig at a recent diktat issued by a Panchayat in Jhajjar district, stating that the girls\nabove the age of 10 cannot wear jeans. \"Why don't you ever talk about a dress code for men? If a\nman is committing a mistake, you will still blame the woman for the kind of clothes she is wearing.\nThis is totally illogical. If a boy wears jeans, why don't you ask him to wear only dhoti and kurta?\nWhy don't you issue a diktat that boys will not roam around with cell phones and get haircuts like\nfilm heroes?\" But if Panchayats are trying to say that either you bring in an amendment or such\nsame things will continue, this is very sad and a matter of serious concern. I think the police should\ntake it with a lot of seriousness and also increase its vigil at places where such diktats are being\nissued.\"88\n3.4 KHAPS RESPONSE TO THE STATE: FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF\nTHE LENS\nThe Supreme Courts observations during the hearing of the petition filed by NGO Shakti\nVahini have not gone down well with the khaps Panchayats. A senior Khap leader in\nMuzaffarnagar district has asked the Supreme Court not to interfere in honour killings and\ndiscourage marriages within the same clan.89 \u201cWe have always been opposed to marriages within\nthe same clan and will continue to do so. The Supreme Court has given orders that anyone can\n87 The khaps have been asking for amendment n the Hindu Marriage Act, 1956 which by virtue of section 29\npermits sagotra marriages.\n88 NCW slams khap Panchayats for imposing customs on young couples, Express News Service:\nChandigarh Tuesday, 24th Sept., 2013\n89Khap asks SC not to interfere in honour killings, 21st February 2014, The Asian Age.\n60\nmarry anybody anywhere. We do not challenge the honourable Supreme Court but they should be\ncareful and not get into this mess.\u201d\nThe Khap leader issued a veiled threat to couples who marry without the approval of the\ncommunity or their parents. They said \u201cIf some girl or boy goes astray and marries on their own,\nthis will not be acceptable. Their parents will decide who they marry. If the couple defies this rule,\nthen the families of both the boy and the girl will be troubled and then the couple will be killed or\nthey will be beaten up\u201d. Khap Panchayats, which are all-male unelected village bodies, are\nnotorious for issuing extra-judicial diktats and even ordering killings in parts of rural India,\nespecially in northern States, but they enjoy such political influence that local politicians rarely\nspeak out against them.90 But the Sarv Khap Panchayat, a conglomerate of 67 khaps in Haryana's\nRohtak district, nonchalantly told the court that it was the family members who lynched girls and\nboys who marry outside their caste or within the same gotra, unable to resist social pressure and\ntaunts of relatives. Regulating the khaps would not reduce honour killings.\nWhen NGO Shakti Vahini, filed a petition in the Supreme Court to get the Central\nGovernment to pass a law to ban the Khaps and other community based Panchayats on the charge\nthat they are all \u201cextra judicial\" bodies, Khaps for a long time were out of the picture as the Khap\nPanchayats were not made a party in the case. The parties to the case were Union of India, Ministry\nof Home Affairs, Ministry of Women and Child, States of Haryana, Punjab, UP, Jharkhand, Bihar,\nHimachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh etc.\nRealizing this anomaly, the Supreme Court Bench of Justice Aftab Alam and Justice\nRanjana Desai indicated that they cannot pass any order in the absence of the affected\nparties. Since Khap Panchayats were not listed as parties in the case, the Supreme Court could not\ninvite them officially. However, the Apex Court let it be known that they are willing to hear\nanybody who has anything to say on the subject.\nIn an affidavit filed on behalf of the Dalal Khap in accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s\nOrder dated 14.01.2013 in the case of Shakti Vahini v. Union of India,91 in Para 5 the khap in\nunequivocal terms, submitted that the so-called honour killings are heinous crimes that have no\n90 Khap asks SC not to interfere in honour killings, The Asian age 21st Feb, 2014.\n91Writ Petition(Civil) no.231/2010\n61\nplace in a society based on respect for human values. It follows that no reasonable person can have\nan objection to steps taken to prevent such heinous crimes or to bring the guilty to justice.\nHowever, the severity of a crime can\u2019t be an excuse for doing away with the principles of natural\njustice, particularly the right to a fair hearing.\nManushi Sanghatan, another NGO, also filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court in\nresponse to the order dated 14.01.2013 and condemned murder or violence of any sort and rejected\nthose who use such violence or coercion based upon the threat of such violence as a means of\nsettling scores or imposing their will or morality on others. Manushi also contended in the affidavit\nthat despite a thorough inquiry and investigation into the functioning of Khaps, Manushi has not\nfound any evidence to support the contention/ proposition that Khap Panchayats are responsible for\n\u2018honour killings\u2019, or for the increase in violent and brutal crimes committed in the name of\n\u201chonour\u201d92 .\nThe Dalal khaps in view of the proceedings of court being conducted without any\nrepresentation from them, until Court finally asked for representation from the Khaps in the last\nhearing, the khaps claim to have been put in the dock as accused answerable for a number of wrong\ndoings including honour killings, curiously, without being formally charged for even one of\nthem.93 The khaps emphasise, the need to guard judicial standards even more fiercely as\nexaggerated and sensationalist media coverage has prejudiced the perception of rural communities\nin the eyes of an urban, news-consuming public. In such an atmosphere, where there is wide-spread\nprejudice against a section of people, it is easy to develop false beliefs about their culpability and\nherein lays a great risk of a miscarriage of justice.94\nManushi also pointed out in its affidavit the functioning of a Khap. While everyone born in\na gotra can claim to be a member of that Khap, every gathering of one or more gotras cannot be\ntermed a Khap meeting. There is a due process involved in convening a Khap meeting, including a\nwritten \u201cniyota\u201d (invitation) by select community representatives. The petitioner has not provided\n92 Para 3\n93 Para 6\n94 Para 7\n62\nany evidence what so ever that any Khap meeting was indeed convened before the honour killings\nattributed to Khaps.95\nThe khaps contended that the petitioner\u2019s case is based on dubious research that seeks of\nconfirmation bias. The methodology is suspicious, the evidence are sketchy and the logic is absurd.\nIn a nutshell, the narrative seems to be that honour killings predominantly happen in Punjab,\nHaryana and UP and the presence of Khaps has a key role to play in this menace. It follows that if\naction is taken against Khaps, then the killings will stop. Interestingly, the Petitioner seems to have\nmissed the small point that Khaps are not prevalent in Punjab, but its research shows highest\nnumber of honour killings in Punjab, providing no explanation for this contradiction.96\nThe khaps also complained of the prejudiced slant of mind of the petitioner organization by\npointing to its zeal to use any argument, howsoever irrelevant or incoherent, to show Khaps in bad\nlight. The word \u2018feudal,\u2019 the khaps point out that has been used with gay abandon without any\ncontext or perspective. Mere ownership of agricultural land doesn\u2019t make a farmer feudal. The bias\nis self evident in the deliberate choice of the language by the Petitioner. Khaps are described as\n\u201cregressive institutions that refuse to embrace modernity\u201d. The gotra customs are described in\nunflattering light as \u201coutmoded system of beliefs\u201d and Khaps as the \u201cself-styled guardians of\nmedieval morality\u201d. The subtext, therefore, is that the rural communities should try to fit with\n\u201cmodern\u201d ways by abandoning their traditions and customs.97\nKhaps also pointed out the contrasting stand of senior police officers of UP & Haryana who\ninformed this Hon\u2019ble Court in the last hearing that they were not aware of any case of violation of\nlaw by the Khaps. Similarly, a Haryana resident, Sh. Suresh Deswal has received information from\nthe Government in response to an RTI application that Khaps in Haryana were not involved in any\nhonour killing incident during the period 2001 to 2011. It is submitted that under such\ncircumstances, the petitioner cannot be allowed to continue to make baseless and unsubstantiated\nallegations against Khaps and paint them in such evil light.98\n95 Para 6\n96 Para 8.\n97 Para 9.\n98 Para 11.\n63\nThe khaps elaborate that there is a different context and reason behind each crime perpetrated\nin the name of honour. Some of these reasons are inter-caste, inter-religion, and gotra restrictions.\nThe percentage of honour killings related to gotra restrictions as a percentage of all honour killings\nacross India is miniscule. They pointed out that even the petitioner\u2019s research inadvertently\nprovides supporting information for this assertion. It is important to note that Khaps have been\nvocal only on the gotra issue, where they have been deliberately misrepresented. But even if one\nwishes to assume the worst about them on the gotra issue, it doesn\u2019t explain why they are being\nimplicated for honour killings related to inter-caste or inter-religion marriages, where they have\nconveyed no objections and indeed in some cases, expressed support.99 Manushi, in fact rubbished\nNCWs report as being based on preconceived notions where the factual findings of report are\ncompletely at variance from the conclusion.100\nThe khaps with a great stress, emphasised on the involvement of families in all the crimes\nthat take place in the name of honour. They contend that irrespective of the reason for the crime\u2014\nwhether caste, religion, gotra, etc.\u2014most honour killings are perpetrated by the victims\u2019 immediate\nfamilies. It is indeed disturbing why families feel compelled to act in a ghastly manner against their\nown kin in the name of honour. But it happens, unfortunately, across the length and breadth of this\ncountry, across urban and rural classes, across castes and communities. That there is a cultural\ncontext behind it is undeniable\u2014 the concept of \u201chonour\u201d, especially with respect to females, is a\ndeeply entrenched belief amongst all sections of Indian society. Even the media that is perennially\non a \u201cmodernization\u201d over-drive is not able to shed such notions. This is self-evident in the\nreporting of rapes where the focus is mostly on the shame brought to the victim, accompanied by\ngraphical representation of feminine images that convey a sense of lost honour. It is in such a\nbackdrop that heinous crimes in the name of honour take place.101\nThe khaps express sadness over the negative media coverage against them as a draconian\ncommunity mocking on gotra customs of Jaats and other rural communities, they believe the\npetitioner and the report of Law Commission of India on this issue have been influenced by the\nnegative media coverage. In the affidavit they briefly described the importance of these customs,\nhence they are necessary. At a basic level, gotra bhaichara denotes a system of brotherhood. The\n99 Para 12\n100 Para 5.\n101 Para 13.\n64\ncommunities following these customs, such as Jaats, consider marriages in same gotra as\nincestuous. In the same way as the society at large may consider a marriage between siblings born\nof same set of parents as incestuous. At this point, it is to be said that even incest can\u2019t be an\nexcuse for murder. If a murder is committed in the name of any custom, the guilty should be\nbrought to justice. But it also needs to be said that such crimes can\u2019t be a stick to beat the people\nfor their cultural beliefs. Contrary to the myth propagated by the media that these customs are\n\u201ctalibani\u201d rules imposed by the Khaps on the people, these customs, like any other cultural\ntraditions, have their own historical context. The voluntary adherence of these customs amongst\ncommunities such as Jaats is very high, even when they become urbanized. Khaps provide\nautonomous, non-governmental platforms where the community can meet and discuss various\nissues affecting it. There are several instances where the interpretation of customs has been relaxed\nin such Panchayats keeping in mind the new ground realities.102\nThat another serious issue of concern is the portrayal of these customs as superstitions or,\nworse, as evil practices like Sati that need to be rooted out. A system of brotherhood provides\nmultiple benefits in a rural setting bereft of the State apparatus and enables cooperation based\npeaceful coexistence. Nevertheless, suffice is to say that it is a matter of faith for these\ncommunities. Article 29 (1) of the Constitution103 guarantee any section of citizens a right to\nconserve their culture. The gotra customs themselves don\u2019t violate any fundamental human rights.\nA support for gotra customs is not the same as support for honour killings\u2013 the continuous\npropaganda in the media equating the two has led to defamation of communities like Jaats or more\ngenerally, the people of Haryana and western UP.104\n102 Para 14\n103 The Constitution of India, 1950. Article 29. Protection of interests of minorities(1) Any section of the\ncitizens residing in the territory of India or any part thereof having a distinct language, script or culture of its\nown shall have the right to conserve the same (2) No citizen shall be denied admission into any educational\ninstitution maintained by the State or receiving aid out of State funds on grounds only of religion, race, caste,\nlanguage or any of them\n46 Para 15.\n65\nCHAPTER - 4\nOBSERVATION AND ANALYSIS OF THE EMPIRICAL STUDY\nCONDUCTED IN THE STATES OF HARYANA, U.P. (WEST), WEST\nBENGAL & RAJASTHAN (INCLUDING DATA AND EMPIRICAL\nINFORMATION).\nFINDINGS FROM FIELD VISIT REGARDING DISCRIMINATION AND\nDEROGATION AGAINST WOMEN BY KHAP AND SOCIETY\n1. STATE OF HARYANA.\nThe field investigators during the period of study, i.e., April-June, 2014, visited six\ndistricts of Haryana- Sonepat/Panipat/Mewat/Rohtak/Hisar and Karnal, out of which district\nMewat is muslim populatd and rest of the districts are\npredominantly dominated by Jaats and are governed\nby the rules/diktats of the khap panchayats. In each\ndistrict we have chosen three villages on the basis of\npurposive sampling. The methodology used was FGD\ni.e., Focussed Group Discussion.\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS\nAmong these districts, Mewat thickly Muslim\npopulated area where ,\n\u2022 Girls generally don\u2019t go to schools, the\nreason being that there are no schools\n66\nin the vicinity. And the parents don\u2019t allow them to go to schools in the town\narea since there is no mode of transport available for commutation.\n\u2022 Female foeticide does not exist in this area due to Sharia reasons.\n\u2022 Same Gotra marriages are absolutely prohibited in this area irrespective of\nreligion. This custom being endorsed by everyone including women,\ncommunity people, Panchayat representatives, as they firmly assert that how\ncan there be marriage between brother and sister as everyone living in the\nsame village are brothers and sisters and even the next village there can be no\nmarriage due to bhaichara.\n\u2022 Inter-caste marriages are also not allowed, which indicates that prohibition of\nsagotra marriages in Muslims is same as in Hindus, which is ironic as there is\nno concept of caste or gotra in Islam. This also proves the extra ordinary\ninfluence of khap Panchayats in the geographical area irrespective of religion.\nIn rest of the districts i.e. Sonepat, Panipat, Rohtak, Hisar and Karnal which are\nbasically Hindu Jaat populated districts, it was observed that,\n\u2022 As compared to Mewat, girls go to schools if available in the village or\nsometimes in the near-by towns.\n\u2022 Female foeticide is rampant. In each family I personally noticed 2-3 boys.\n\u2022 With respect to same gotra marriages, the same strict prohibition rule applies\namongst Hindus and Muslims. Inter-caste marriages are also not allowed.\nHowever, as per the recent news reporting, the Satrol Khap has allowed Inter-\ncaste weddings and marriages between the families within a radius of 42\nvillages. Inter-caste marriages have been a major reason for so called \u201chonour\nkillings\u201d in the recent past. However, marriages within same village and same\ngotra are still barred.105\nA common practice amongst all the people in the area cutting across religious/caste\ndifferences is the not giving share in property to women. Upon being asked by the\nresearchers especially to the women of the localities about the awareness of their share in\n105 Manveer Saini, \u201cKhap Panchayat Okays Marriages between Castes,\u201d The Times of India, dated April 21,\n2014.\n67\nproperty whether under personal or statutory law, it was found out that most of the women\nare aware of their right and share. However, when asked whether they are given their share\nor do they claim their share, at first they did not reply but on insistence, they replied that if\nthey discuss such things, the relationship between family members would sour, \u201crishtey\nkharab ho jayenge\u201d being the standard statement. Amongst Muslims, the relinquishment of\nproperty rights is almost implied and never discussed. Amongst Hindus, the women are\nmade to transfer the property to their brothers before they get married. When men/khap\nPanchayat members were asked about the property rights of women they openly say they\ndon\u2019t give property to women because of the burden of various obligation a male member of\nthe family has to bear in the form of dahez, bhaat and chuchak as well as every time the\nsister visits or when they visit their sister/daughter\u2019s matrimonial home, they have to give\ngifts. In fact during the discussion it was revealed\nthat now a days most of the parents gets there\ntheir daughters share transferred in the name of\nmale member. The reason cited was that after the\ndaughters marriage it may be complicated by her\nin laws family and they may interfere property\nright.\n\u2022 As regard to the role of the\nauthorities (DC, Police officials\nand other authorities) upon being\nasked, they stated that their role is\nNil as this being the Khaps and\nvillagers/locals personal issues\nwhich are not being reported to\nthem so they have no authority to\nintervene or take any action. Also authorities confided in us on the condition\nof anonymity that they also believe in such customs and practice because they\nare the son of this state and their values are same.\n68\nFrom the original approximately data profiled by the study.\nFINDINGS\n1. MEWAT ( HARYANA)\n\u2022 The khaps in Mewat area are known as Pal Panchayat. The Pal under\ninvestigation is the Dedhgadh Pal. The head of a Pal, also known as the\nSarpanch in these Pal Panchayats is known as the Choudary. The Current\nChoudary of the Pal being investigated is Choudary Zakir Hussain. The\ncentre for the administration of this pal is Gwalda in Rajasthan and the\nambit of its jurisdiction extends to all the regions where a population of\npersons belonging to the Dedhgadh Pal reside. In effect, the jurisdiction of\nthe Dedhgadh Pal extends over 90 districts (Zilla). A Pal is not divided on\nreligious basis.\n69\n\u2022 The there is a division\nof the village of the\nregion under 12 Pals.\nThey are,\n1. Dedhgadh Pal\n2. Chirakhloth (the biggest)\n3. Gorwal\n4. Dedhwal\n5. Bagodia\n6. Punloth\n7. Duloth\n8. Baloth\n9. Sringal\n10. Debroth\n11. Mangarian\n12. Goumal\n\u2022 A Pal, as classified above further has branches. It has been noted that a Pal does not\nallow for any marriages within their gotra. If some boy or girl marries against this\nnorm, the possible repercussions are,\n1. Forced dissolution of marriage.\n2. Banishment\n3. Criminal charges being pressed against the male dissenter.\n\u2022 Membership to a Pal is not on the basis of geographical distribution; rather, it is on\nthe basis of influence. No person from the village under investigation is a member\nof the Pal. Decision of the Pal is taken on the basis of the consensus of the parties.\nOnce there is an agreement to submit to the jurisdiction of a Pal then the decision of\nthe Pal shall be binding upon such parties.\n70\n\u2022 There has been a transition in the attitude whereby the Muslims have realized that\ntheir laws allow for marriage even in the first relation whereby the long riding\nregional customs do not apply to them. Despite that they concede that such an act of\nmarriage is not preferred. In a village, the Villagers claim that it is for 30-40 years\nsince such acts have taken place.\n\u2022 It has been noted that earlier punishments included possible banishment from the\nvillage, corporal punishment and the banning of the harvest of the agricultural fields\nbelonging to the family of the dissenters.\n\u2022 There has been a transition in the attitude towards the girl child and her education.\nIt has been put forth that the Villagers try to educate the girl child based upon her\nability and wishes.\n\u2022 There is an acceptance of the fact that an agricultural income could not have been\nachieved without the contribution of women in this region.\nA. REVASAN (MEWAT, HARYANA)\nThe Field Investigator met around 30-40the affected persons ie , their family members and\nPanchayat members.\n\u2022 Village Rewasan also has people belonging to the Dedhgadh Pal and their sub-\ndivision is Ghasedia. In Village Rewasan it can be noted that some villagers claim\nthat there is still much Pal activity in the area and there is much respect for its\nfunctions.\n\u2022 Prohibition of same gotra marriage is very strictly followed\n\u2022 In addition to the same, some people in village Rewasan conceded that only 5% of\nthe population in this area educate the girl child. Most of the girls want to study but\nthey are not allowed and they have to perform household work.\n\u2022 Commuting to college/school is a major problem especially in this time when the\ngirls safety is emerging as one of the important issues. Girls have to go too far for\nschool as no educational institution is available in village. Girls go to mosque for\nstudying Quran. Women are involved in household work and field work. If they\nwould study further, who would work in the field. Also, the chances of marriage of a\n71\ngirl is decreased is she is educated as it would be difficult to find a suitable match for\nher.\n\u2022 There is no preferential treatment given to boys over girls and both are treated\nequally.\n\u2022 In Muslim community no sex selection or female foeticide is permitted as abortion is\nconsidered to be a sin under Islamic law. Large number of children in absence of\nfamily planning leads to poverty.\n\u2022 Property rights are never discussed in open as the women fear straining of\nrelationships if they demand there share in property.\nB. ADBAR (MEWAT)\n\u2022 Women who want their girls to study are dominated by men. They are afraid of\nsocial stigma attached to education as the girls who study are considered to become\nrebellious who get out of control.\n\u2022 The youth have different thinking pattern and they want to change the society and\nprovide education to their kids.\n\u2022 Early marriage is a common phenomenon.\n\u2022 Men do not work and show cruelty towards women who earn money by working in\nfields.\n72\n\u2022 Most of the authorities including police\nbelong to the same community and their\nonly concern is their job.\n\u2022 In view of the elders the youth is not\nconcerned about social norms. They do not\nneed to or have any fear of the Pal.\nHowever, the effect of disregard for the\ndecision of the Khap is changing. Earlier,\nthe community used to get together in support of the Person in whose favour the Pal\ndecides but now the Community has been noted to support the person against the\ndecision of the Khap.\n\u2022 In case of dissent, there is more pressure on the family of the boy. In case the men do\nnot agree to solution through Pal, it is most likely that reports of abduction and rape\nbe charged against them.\n\u2022 In marriages, dowry is highly prevalent and there is a unilateral flow of spouses, for\nexample, if someone marries a woman from village X, he shall not marry his sister or\nany other female member of his family to a man in village X.\n2. SONEPAT (Kakroi, Badhkhalsa, Tihadakalan) /PANIPAT\n(Ujha/Ugrakhedi/Seewah)106 / ROHTAK (Mokhra, Madina,\nSampla)/ HISAR/KARNAL\nThe journey towards this research began in our taxi from Delhi to Sonipath, where we\nwere accompanied with researcher Ms. Shabeena and Kaushal who had previously visited\nvarious research destinations. For generation of an atmosphere where people can freely\nspeak their mind we had chosen a facilitator, who was acquainted with culture, people, and\nmind-set so that we could interview without any hassles. The MLA was the first person who\ngave us the background of existence of Khap Panchayat. Khap means any caste and khap\nPanchayat means Panchayat constituting reputed members of that caste of society which,\ndecides on various social issues. It\u2019s an advisory body according to his survey Khap\u2019s has\n106 See Interviews annexed.\n73\nnever given any orders of honour killing it\u2019s the people who have done this especially in the\ncases of same gotra marriages.\nGENERAL OBSERVATION\n\u2022 Each caste has its own Khap elected by hereditary order, but only male member can\nbe chosen as Khap. 12 villages together form the Sarva khap. In Tihad Kala village\n36 cast Panchayats exist.\n\u2022 Khap interfere in issues related to social norms and values and the judgment is based\non consent of all Khap members. They do not interfere in personnel issues of people.\n\u2022 Khap Panchayat has political support from local MLA and from community member\nas well. No one has dared to voice against the Khap.107\n\u2022 Political power is confined in male, women must vote but can not decide to whom\nthey should cast their vote, it is decided by male member of family. The reason was\ngiven that male has links to other people and they engage in meeting the home needs\nso they will decide to whom the relation be built. It means to researcher that in the\nname of work and outdoor activities male wants to dominate female member and\nsnatch political rights of women.\n\u2022 In house mostly decision related to power play are taken by male and women have no\nsay in that. In the same way male member decides about marriage of daughter, and\nshe does not have any saying in the matter. But it was negated by Mr Jai Tirat, he is\nan MLA and might be that his family is well educated so they demand their rights\nforcefully.\n\u2022 In marriage gotra system is followed very strictly, gotra is recognized in 3 peedhi.\n107 Interview of the political leader Mr Jai Teerath can be referred to in the annexure.\n74\n\u2022 Property is divided as per the social customs of society. The custom is based on\nmaintaining relation by giving up property by female to her parents or brothers.\nSome people stated that if a female takes her share from parents or brothers that\nmean she is losing her relation from parents and brother. It reflected that their social\nand even blood relation will remain until and unless the girls give up her property in\nfavour of her parents and brothers. They justified it saying that we give more than\nthat property as gift to women but it was not reasonable as no one wish to give more\nin exchange of less, some people justified it as social norms. Sex selection in Hindu\nfamily is practiced, not in Hindu. In most cases, if two girls are born then after,\nmedical checks-up take place and sex selection is practiced.\n\u2022 In education, boys are motivated while girls are not. It is done in expenditure and\nfacilities given to both sexes. Boys are given more pocket money than girls.\n\u2022 It was observed that people do not wish to let researcher meet female member of\ncommunity. The reason, to the field investigators understanding could only be the\nfear dwelling in the men\u2019s hearts about the women speaking against the male\ndominance. Whatever control they put on girls and women they call it as preserving\nthe cultural heritage of society, they do it in fact but at some extent they cross the line\nsuch as barring girls from mobile and individual liberty.\n\u2022 It is considered that till three generation the gotra should not be same. It shall also not\nbe same to mother, neither to grandmother ie., nani gotra. According to them\nbelonging to same gotra makes them brothers and\nsisters and makes marriage unacceptable in society.\n\u2022 the main crimes against women faced in Haryana are:\no Female foeticide\no Gender discrimination as a girl child.\no Property Rights\nCONCLUSION\nThe exploratory research in district Sonepat/\nPanipat/Karnal/Hisar/Rohtak in the state of Haryana, reveals\nmany realities of the position of women and the attitude of Khaps towards the issue. By\n75\nanalysis of unstructured questions and answers many inferences can be drawn. Firstly, the\nsociety is primarily male dominant, women do not have much political right as her right of\nadult suffrage is subjected to the wish of male member of his family. Secondly, she has a\nvery complicated property rights which is unique feature of state as she gets share in\nproperty, but there is a social obligation to relinquish the share failing to which she loses her\nfamily ties, which ultimately makes the relation with parents and brother strained. So, in sum\nand substance that right is subjected to many negative conditions.\nAs far as sex ratio of women is concerned, in each village we saw many children varying\nfrom 5yrs to 15 yrs most of them were boys, which clearly indicates poor child sex ratio.\nPeople clearly say having a son is boon and certainly they go to any extent of wrongful\nthings, to have a son. In the interview one of the person who was husband of lady sarpanch,\nalso member of Khap said if somebody doesn\u2019t has son he shall adopt the same. This clearly\nshows importance of male gender in the state. In all the families we visited we saw, son in\nthe family serving tea, which was really appreciable, but the common things in all families\nwas all of them were having two sons and no daughter, which clearly shows gender selective\napproach.\n76\n2. WESTERN UTTAR PRADESH\nMUZAFFARNAGER (Mohalla Mallupura,Villages Kakroi, Shahpur, Lisad, Sisoli,\nFugana) MEERUT(Ajrara, Bhopgarh, Harra) And BAGHPAT(Asara, Bauud,\nDhikoli).\nGENERAL OBSERVATION\nMuzaffarnagar town\nDuring the interview with a leading advocate108 who has been involved in successful\nprosecution of accused of honour crimes the researcher got an impression that-\n\u2022 Khap do not exist in the urban society generally but wherever it is applicable,\nit is restricted mainly to the lower class people. The well educated higher\nclass people to a large extent do not abide by its diktats as strictly as the lower\nclass people.\n108 Interview annexed\n77\n\u2022 Mainly due to their financial incapacity to influence others and lack of ability\nto shift anywhere the lower class people are forced to abide by its diktats\nstrictly which is not simply the case with the upper class people.\n\u2022 In previous 5-10 years there have been barely 5-7 cases which can be\ncategorized under KHAP excesses. Though there are a few other cases but\nthere can\u2019t truly be described as Khap cases of honor killings for there has\nbeen number of reasons and circumstances explaining the same.\nFrom the original approximate data profiled by the study.\nThe views of the lawyer can be substantiated with further enquiry with different respondents.\n78\nA. VILLAGE LISAD (MUZAFFARANAGAR)\n\u2022 Khap\u2019s is an age old tradition continuing since forefathers of the respondents\nin the area and all the village people follow it with their heart & soul.\n\u2022 The designation of choudhary is the supreme in any Khap. The post is a\nhereditary one and the decisions of choudhary are final and binding on all\nvillages/villagers coming under that Khap.\n\u2022 Baba Harkishan Singh is choudhary109 for nearly 30+ years and his Khap\n(Gatwara) comprises 52 villages under it. Though it is not a fixed number and\ndifferent Khaps happen to have different number of villages viz. 32, 52,82\netc.\n\u2022 Earlier (nearly 15-20 years ago) Khap Panchayat were very prominent and\nwidely known for committing honor killings. However over the time this\ntrend has slowed down and number of cases reduced significantly with\nintensity of Khaps decreasing sharply due to migration & many others\nfactors.\n\u2022 A common views of the Khap Panchayat members as well as of the local\npeople regarding same Gotra marriage and the Khap\u2019s rule is that no girl &\nboy out of there 52 villages can marry with each other for they belongs to the\nsame Gotra. If done so they will be boycotted by the society as well as their\nfamilies. If either of their families continues to support them, then that family\nwill also be boycotted by the entire society.\n\u2022 There is nothing like honor killing and the social boycott serves the purposes\nof Khap. 5-10 such cases of social boycott has been witnessed in previous 5-\n10 year. However such instances have significantly reduced now and the\nyoung boys & girls have become respectful of the Khap\u2019s rule.\n\u2022 Khap has no impact on gender inequality rather it has facilitated gender\nequality many a times. Girls and women feel safer due to Khap and its diktats\nand are promoted to complete higher education viz. B.A, M.A, Ph.D etc.No\nspecific dress code for women and they are free to wear whatever they chose.\n109 See interview annexed.\n79\nCONCLUSION\nIt appeared to the researcher that the Khap\u2019s rules have been internalized by the\nvillagers as a matter of deeper socialization and hence there are lesser cases of violation.\nHowever, with increase of migration in urban areas and change in life style due to the impact\nof globalization, a change is been witnessed in the approach of youngsters. It was also\nobserved by the investigator that there are good facilities viz. high schools, colleges, etc. for\ngirl\u2019s education and people are pro- girl\u2019s education in the area. Even in terms of dressing\nand free movement outside four walk of houses, the girls and women were found roaming\nfreely.\nDespite all the modernization that has\nseeped into the village life, Khap continues to\nbe a reality for all the villages & people coming\nunder it. However, with the passage of time &\nsocial change the Khaps as well seem to have\nadapted to continue being relevant to for the\nyounger generations.\nB. VILLAGE SISOLI\n(MUZAFFRANAGAR)\n\u2022 In village Sisoli, the Balyan\nKhap exist which comprises of\n82 villages within it. As per\nchoudhary there has been nearly\n100 cases of honor killing in the\npast 10-20 years. The rigidity and\nstrictness of Balyan Khap is well\nknown across in the near about\nvillages.\n\u2022 If girls and boys of the same\nGotra i.e. same Khap commit marriage their only punishment used to be was\ndeath. However, over the time this trend has softened a bit and social boycott\n80\nof the guilty persons and their families have become a popular culture. At\npresent there are two families facing social boycott in the village. Recently,\nthe daughter of a Pandit\u2019s Family married with a Jat Boy. Now the Pandit\u2019s\nfamily has run away from the village but the Jat\u2019s family continue to reside in\nthe village however, they face widespread boycott by all village the members\n\u2022 According to the khap members the Supreme Court of India has resulted in\nconstituting few useless rules like allowing the same gotra marriages. But\nthese continue to be irrelevant in their Khaps.\n\u2022 Despite being bit harsher towards Khap rules Balyan Khap too is almost\nequally liberal and open to girl\u2019s education at all levels. No dress code for\ngirls being followed.\nCONCLUSION\nThere are degrees of variations in the functioning pattern of various Khaps. However their\nmandates continue to be the same i.e preventing same Gotra marriage and gender\ndiscrimination is subtle but deep in the veins of their traditional societies. The researcher\nnoticed that the middle aged choudhary were very rude & stubborn to Jat rules. Girls and\nwomen were observed being free & doing their normal activities without any perceptible\nfear of this khap as well.\nC. VILLAGE ASARA (BAGHPAT)\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS\nBased on widespread media reports and surveying secondary literature like Jagran\nPost news dated 13th July 2012 which loudly establishes Asara Village as a place of\nVehement Khap Diktat the investigator visited the said village community to witness the\nground reality and collect empirical evidence in support of the same, and observed,\n\u2022 Any woman below 40 years of age is not allowed to go for shopping nor can she use\nmobile phone as per the diktat of local village Panchayat.\n81\n\u2022 Any sort of love marriage is strictly prohibited and no member of the village\ncommunity can be allowed to choose his/her life partner which is exclusively a\nprerogative and domain of the elders.\n\u2022 However, there is no restriction to the education of girls and women. They are\nallowed to complete their education freely till they get married by their parents.\n\u2022 Women and girls have to follow dress code as set by the village Panchyat and they\ncan\u2019t wear jeans or any western looking clothes in public or in front of elders.\nMuslim Women observed on roads were mostly in Burqa\n\u2022 Not all people were comfortable in sharing with an outsider about the diktat of their\nPanchayat and the majority seemed hesitant to let an outsider encroach and ask\nquestions about their village Panchayat.\n\u2022 The investigator tried to approach to a woman respondent, but the lady shied away\nand further villagers came in order to avoid any interaction between the two.\n\u2022 People Shared proudly about their village culture saying-\n\u201c Sanskar bachange to pariwar bachega,\nPariwar bachange to samaj bachega,\nSamaj bachega to Desh bachega\u201d\nD. VILAGE FUGANA (MUZAFFARNAGAR)\nFugana was one of the worst affected villages of the Muzzaffarnagar riots of August,\n2013. After the riots a police team of UP police came to arrest the local men who were\nall named in the FIRs against them but then the women of the village jammed road and\nthus saved their sons and husband from getting arrested.\nGENERAL OBSERVATION\n\u2022 One of the village man shared with the investigator in solitude that there are\nfrequent rape cases in the village mainly by the upper class like the Pradhan\u2019s son\nhimself. It was also shared that there are 4-5 gang rape victims which still are\nliving under great stigma and social boycott inside the village for a minor mistake\nof opposing the interests of upper class or getting into love marriages.\n82\n\u2022 There is no specific restriction on women\u2019s education and all the villagers\nappeared equivocal about women being provided equal opportunity for\neducation.\n\u2022 There is no dress code specified for the women and again all the villagers nearly\nunanimously supported that women are allowed to wear clothes as per their wish.\n\u2022 Women were seen on roads wearing normal (so called) clothes and not observing\nburqa or Prada strictly. There was wide number of girls seen or roads returning\nfrom schools.\n\u2022 About prevalent gang rape cases, most of the villagers seemed closed to talk, only\na few people were found having deep anger about these shameful incidents.\nWomen are playing central role in this society but patriarchy indirectly or directly\nuse them for their petty interests, be it protecting them from police arrests or\nbeing subjected to gang rapes. In a nutshell, the discrimination continues being\nsubtle and deep.\n83\n3. STATE OF WEST BENGAL\nI . BIRBHUM\nA. SHANTI NIKETAN (BOLPUR)\nShalishi is a form of informal village community which comprises all the residents of\nvillage as its members. Shalishi is headed by an elected representative of all he male adult\nmembers of a village. There is no participation either in its election or in its functioning\npattern. Salishi looks after and aims to resolve and issue arising with or among village\nmembers. It is an extra judicial institution and its existence is neither approved nor\nrecognized by formal law. Salishi generally dictate on marital issues. It allows its male\nmembers to marry any non-tribal women/girl, however, it strictly prohibits a tribal woman/\nfemale to marry a non-tribal man. In case she marries a non-tribal man she can stay away\noutside the village territories but not allowed to integrate with her tribal roots. It to be seen\nhere that the Infamous Birbhum gang rape case involved a woman eloping with a non tribal\nmale. The women is generally punished by fine or rape.\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS\n\u2022 The organisation visited by the investigator is working well for near about 30\nyears and has significant achievements to share in the field of social well\nbeing of vulnerable sections particularly women. Their achievements are\nfine but why overall situation is not changing or improving?\n84\n\u2022 According to the shanti niketan officials, the organisation has succeeded in\nstopping child marriage which is a common practice in the said locality\n(Birbhum).\n\u2022 The institution of Salishi allows its married girls (within tribal community to\ninherit their parents property equally) as their brothers. Though in most\ncase as per popular trends the married women don\u2019t claim for their parent\u2019s\nproperty for it guarantees them a loving relation with their parent\u2019s family\nand also avoids to their husbands family.\nThe visit was meaningful and informative. The institution of Shalishi is similar to Khap in its\ncomposition and functioning pattern. However, in terms of rigidity and political affiliations\nSalishi appears far more neutral and flexible. But the attitude of keeping women aloof from\nits composition and regulating their personal and marital behavior forces to recognize its\npatriarchal traditions and oppressive practices.\n85\nFrom the original approximate data profiled by the study.\nB. PURENDRAPUR,\nSalishi is considered to be a pro people institution among the local people of these villages.\nIt is said to help the poor and needy. People find it to be more accessible and quick in\ndispensation of dispute resolutions and thus prefer to go to sailishi adalats instead of going to\nthe state for dispute resolution. It plays active role in organisation of community functions\nviz. marriages etc of villagers.\n86\n\u2022 It doesn\u2019t allow inter-caste (outside tribe) marriages. However unlike Khap if\nmarriage is completed, the villagers are of the opinion that no extreme radical step\nlike honor killing takes place.\n\u2022 If a man marries a non-tribal woman he can stay in the villages but if a woman does\nso she has to necessarily leave the village forever and live as an outcast.\n\u2022 As far as the land transfer/holding to married women is concerned, they are allowed\nto take parts in the inherited property of their parents; however in most of the cases\nthey don\u2019t claim so due to social norms and popular practices.\n\u2022 Most of the villagers support the institution of Salishi for its pro people and less rigid\napproach.\n\u2022 It appears that media reports quite exaggerated and Salishi is a more reputed and\ncredible institution\namong villagers.\n\u2022 It is difficult to have the\nfinal word about an age\nold institution after a\nfew days visit. However\nthe preliminary findings\nare encouraging and put\na positive impression about the institution as the local people support it with all\nmight.\n87\n2. BANKURA(Barikul, Purnapusma)\n\u2022 Girls are not encouraged to be taught more, for it creates further problem in them\ngetting married to a suitable groom. In a particular caste called \u2018Sabar\u2019 on record\nthere is only one girl who is 10th\npassed in a population of 10,000\ncomprising nearly 50% women.\n\u2022 Child marriage is still a very dominant\npractice among tribals in this\nregion. Especially among girls who\nare married before 17.\n\u2022 Women are granted with property\nrights however they don\u2019t claim\nany such rights for the sake of their husband\u2019s honour and for maintaining good\nrelations with the parental family.\n\u2022 In case tribal girl marries a non-tribe man her family is literally forced by the village\ncommunity and Sailshi in particular to commit the post death rituals of their\nhappily married & alive daughter/sister.\n\u2022 Status of girls is very poor in this locality and is even worse among tribals. No\nparticular dress code or restriction was either told or observed by the investigator.\nAmong the localities visited so far Bankura seems to be most oppressive in terms of gender\ndiscriminations. The oppressions are age old and inherent to the extents that have been\naccepted as natural by the villagers in general. The wo man were not allowed to interact\nwith the field investigator as they practice purdah system.\n3. BARDHAMAN/NORTH 24 PARGANA\n\u2022 No major role of Salishi in the village/community manners.\n\u2022 Women enjoy comparatively better position than their counterparts in other tribal\nlocalities.\n\u2022 Child marriage cases are rarely heard.\n\u2022 Education status is better and in sync with the non tribal villages of West Bengal.\nDowry is a practice and is accepted across the zone.\n88\n\u2022 Crime against women is negligible (on record at least) and cases of domestic\nviolence are rarely recorded.\n\u2022 Married women are granted with the property rights and it has been found in various\ninstances that they are well about it. However, the instances of honour and\nsocietal norms play a decisive role, here again and it has been widely observed\nthat they don\u2019t make claims in the inherited property of their parents.\n\u2022 The residents appear happier and wealthier in their outlook. The locality is greener\nand full of people.\n\u2022 As shared by the respondents, the locality appears better in terms of infrastructure\nviz. roads, schools & hospitals.\n\u2022 Unlike previous three localities more women and girls are visible on road. No\nparticular dress code is being observed by the young girls and women.\n\u2022 Much information was not gathered from the women because of language problem\nalso they were shy to interact with outsiders.\nVisiting the selected localities in south West Bengal zone, has been an informative\nexperience. The social sphere has been varying in terms of intensity and gravity of\ndifferences in gender and caste relations. Salishi is a ground reality and age old institution\naccepted widely. However, the gender inequality has been more than evident and women\nsuffer a member of restrictions at both psychological and physical level. Marital laws norms\nare strict and are observed across communities, though they are more rigid and oppressive\nfor women than that of men of these communities. Apart from keeping women away from\ncomposition and election process of the Salishi they are completely at the receiving end of\nits marital diktats. Women observe purdah system and are either naturally shy or not allowed\nto interact with outside people. As there was language problem also, it was a difficult to get\ntheir point of view by means of personal interview.\nNonetheless, it is not to forget that Salishi has major social acceptance at its credit and\nhas contributed in making the lives of villagers easier through more than one ways viz. easy\nresolution of disputes etc. However, there is a lot of scope to women in their localities and\nincreasing their claim to property ownerships as a popular practice can be one of the\nimmediate steps to begin with.\n89\n4. STATE OF RAJASTHAN\n1. BIKANER\nA. Naikon ka mohalla in Bikaner City (Nai (barber): a\nscheduled caste community)\nThere are certain instance but no violence took place, rather a\ndifferent practice is seen where if a boy from the community\nmarries then it is accepted but if a girl marries she is being\nout-casted for life time under which she then have no\nrelationship with any of the family members as well as the\ncommunity.\n120 PROHIBITION OF\nSAMEGOTRA\n100 100 100 100 100 100\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\nFrom the original approximate data profiled by the study\n90\nB. UDRAMSAR\nUdramsar is a big interior bit interior, with a population of more than 6000 people living\nwith majority caste-Yadav (Ahir)\n\u2022 According to the Sarpanch110 of the area, no inter-caste marriage has taken place in\nthe recent past in the village. But he has heard of some instances where highly\nopposed by the respective families of the couple, but no violence is reported. And he\ncites the reason for this is fear of going to jail else according to him they should be\nshot dead and this only is the solution to stop this nonsense. He says there is no\nPanchayat as such to decide on matters like this rather they are solved or dealt with\non personal planes.\n\u2022 It is noted during the conversation with the people that community people are\nreluctant to inter-caste marriages because these \u201crules\u201d are followed since long time\nand this forms a custom and these customs cannot be deviated with, moreover their\nelders were not fools that they made these rules, rather they were more\nknowledgeable and smarter than them and all these rules have a definite logic behind\nthem.\n\u2022 In view of the local people, when children get educated and then they don\u2019t respect\ntheir customs and culture which forbids them to marry a person of some other caste.\nThey are sent to study and not to love somebody. By getting into all these things they\nbreak out the trust and in addition hurt their parents to the extent that parent\u2019s\nreputation among the society is damaged.\n\u2022 The advancement in IT sector has led to chatting and web calling etc. this in turn\ncorrupts the mind of children leading them to get involved in craps like love\nmarriages.\nC. UDASAR,\nUdasar is a roadside village, with a population of around 5000 comprising a mixture of\npeople consisting of Rajputs, Brahmins, Jats and some Scheduled Castes.\n110 Not of Panchayati Raj Institution\n91\n\u2022 According to them there aren\u2019t any cases\nconcerning honour killing. But inter-caste\nmarriages should be discouraged according to\nthem.\n\u2022 The people from the Udasar village were reluctant\nto talk over the issue and did not pay much heed to\nit. But the opinions and the response of the people\nand khap Panchayat from the Udramsar village\ngives an insight into the causes and reasons for the opposition towards inter-caste\nmarriages. The Bikaner region doesn\u2019t witness violence or evidence any community\ncourt which decides on the concerned matter rather it is the elders of the family that\nreacts over the issues. The girls are not educated as education leads to love marriages\nand inter-caste marriages.\n\u2022 According to the police officials, no inter-caste marriage conflicts are being reported.\nAccording to the officer concerned only minor issues come up, that is being settled at\nthe family level. He said reluctance to inter-caste marriages are largely seen in\nvillages and couples normally leave their families to reside separately.\n2. JHUNJHUNU (DHOJASAR)\n\u2022 People of the area are of the view that there are no Khap Panchayat like issues\ninvolved and everything is fine in his village. According to him people are ready to\naccept the inter-caste marriages these days, thus there are no victims to such\nmarriages.\n\u2022 According to the interaction with the local people, there have been certain instances\nof honour killings in the village where either both the girl and the boy concerned are\nkilled or sometimes if the boy is outsider (belongs to some other village) then he is\nkilled and the girl is taken away from the village and married to some other person.\nThey also said that this is right as a girl carries the reputation of the family and a\n92\nperson isn\u2019t a person without reputation and this reputation corresponds to pride\nattached to the females of the family.\n\u2022 A five year old Instance as narrated by a resident of the village- a boy belonging to\nJangid caste and a girl belonging to Jaat community were trying to run away from the\nvillage to marry, but they were caught and killed, thereafter thrown into the well. The\npolice was bribed and it was reported as a suicide case. Recently no such case has\ncome up in this village.\n3. JODHPUR\n\u2022 According to an Advocate111 of the Jodhpur High Court a few instances of violence\npertaining to inter-caste marriages are seen in Bharatpur (a District in eastern\nRajasthan) area where unrecognized panchayats (probably Khap Panchayats) order\nthe community members to outcaste the couples or the female and certain fine to be\nimposed if anybody talks to them. Even the family members have to disown them\nelse they shall also face the same. In Urban areas otherwise only the family members\nreact to such issues and in few cases violence is seen, most of them are accepted after\nsome time.\n\u2022 The role of police remains neutral as they don\u2019t interfere in\nthe village affairs. Without any complaint being filed they\navoid taking any suo moto actions.\nA. HIMMATPURA (Rajput Majority Village)\n\u2022 According to the local people a girl represents the\nreputation of the community and she marrying to a boy of\nanother caste is like making fun of the community (slang\n111 See interview annexed\n93\nused). Killing them brings nothing back but at least creates a sense of fear among the\nothers to not to dare sell out the reputation of their caste/community in the world.\n\u2022 The caste system is very much prevalent, and even the educated follow the rigidity of\nthe caste system. They feel that the authorities should understand the relevance of\ncaste system and customs should be given prevalence over anything and it is the law\nof the nature and should not be deviated with.\n\u2022 It is because of the rigidity of the caste system that the honour killings take place.\n\u2022 Women are generally kept away from\npublic affairs as they are not educated.\n\u2022 Female foeticide is very much prevalent.\nB. GUMANPURA (Rajput Majority\nVillage)\nThe village people refused to talk much on the\nmatter and said there are no such Panchayats that\nsit on these matters and family these days accept\ntheir children as they don\u2019t have much of a choice to make. According to the women, local\npeople, no more caste Panchayats exist in the area. It is the elderly who decide on the family\nrelated issues such as same caste marriages, love marriages or dealing with the women\nrelated issues.\n4. A. Siker (Kaasli, Bheenchri)\nB Hanumangarh(Bhaddi, Munsa)\nC. Churu(Rajpura, Modavasi)\nGeneral observations\n\u2022 Caste/khap Panchayats exists but their existence is denied to the field\ninvestigators.\n\u2022 Quiet often honour killings cases occur but they are kept secret and no report\nis being filed.\n94\n\u2022 Education of the girls is not encouraged. At times, education of the girls is\nless due to the non availability of schools in near vicinity.\n\u2022 Purdah system is followed\n\u2022 Female foeticide is rampant because nobody wants to bar the responsibility of\ngirl child.\n\u2022 No property rights are given to the females. Most of the time they are not\naware and even if they are aware, they don\u2019t claim it for the fear of straining\nrelationship with the family.\nGender discrimination is particularly evident in education in Rajasthan where boys\nare more likely to attend school. The traditional place of the woman is in the home and so\nmany parents and children consider education for girls to be a waste of time, especially when\nthe child can instead be working or performing domestic chores. The main purpose of\nparents to marry their son is to get a daughter in law who can manage house hold work. The\nstatus of a daughter in law is not more than that of an unpaid servant.\nChild Marriage is another way in which girls are disadvantaged. In addition to\nlimiting educational possibilities and stunting personal development, early marriages carry\ngrave health risks. A girl under 15 is five times more likely to die during pregnancy than a\nwoman in her twenties; her child is also more likely to die. The custom of ghoongat is very\nmuch prevalent in Rajasthan and widely followed. Women have no authority in decision\nmaking of house. They are not even allowed to talk or come in front of in laws who are\nmales.\nGirls also carry the liability of dowry and leave the family home after marriage,\nparents thus prefer to have male offspring. This is the major cause of rampant female\nfeticide.\n95\nCHAPTER -5\nSUGGESTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nWith extreme demonization in the media of khap panchayats, shalishi adalats and other\nkangaroo style courts as being extremely sinister institutions, retrogressive to the core, the research\nteam began the quest for truth. The result of the study reinforces the patriarchal nature of the rural\nIndian society which follows discriminatory practices against women in general.\nBefore coming onto any conclusion, it becomes very important for us to understand, that\nkhap Panchayat is an age old institutions with deep seated roots in the society where it exists. It is\na different form of Panchayat. Second type of Panchayat is which is elected and constituted under\nthe Panchayati Raj Act. Third, when a group of persons in the village assemble and discuss about\nrelevant issues, although not elected, it is also called a Panchayat. Khap is a different unit\naltogether. Khap is not made of one gotra but when more than three or four gotras assemble\ntogether and discuss some issue that is called a khap Panchayat.\nThe Panchayati Raj Institutions as the highest form of democratic decentralisation had been\nconstitutionally recognized fairly recently as compared to the Khap Panchayats which have been\nin existence. Before the Constitutional (73rd amendment act, 1992) when the Panchayati Raj\nInstitutions got constitutional recognition, it was the Khap Panchayats that looked after the welfare\nof the masses, and this is the reason why khaps have so much of power on the masses. Quick\nresolution of disputes, distrust of the judicial system where cases can take years to dispose\noff, are two major reasons why the rural masses put their trust in the kangaroo style courts\nwhich are approachable, quick and efficient and trustworthy as being one of them. In the area\nof study the PI visited along with the research team, the constitutionally established Panchayati\nRaj Institution seems to be a failure for two reasons. Firstly, the 33% reservation provided for\nwomen is practically ineffective means of women empowerment as the women Pradhan is always\na dummy representative in the highly Patriarchal society and it is the husband or any other male\nmember of the family who is the de facto pradhan. A woman pradhan only and strictly works\non the aid and advice of the male members of her family who happen to be the members of\nthe Khap Panchayat or otherwise yield high social influence.\n96\nSince the khaps yield control on a large number of villagers and vote en bloc shifting\nentire voting trends, there is very much politicization of Khap Panchayats by local politicians\nto sustain themselves in the political mainstream. Politicians justify the activities of\nkhaps/kangaroo courts by terming them as cultural institutions rooted in the past, thereby giving\nthem a new lease of life. The institution which could have died a natural death by the\nconcretization of the constitutionally recognized Panchayati Raj Institutions, has been revived and\ngiven some legitimacy by vote bank politics and enabled it to emerge in a retrograde avatar. Khaps\nas has been observed in the study are quintessentially patriarchal in nature and when it comes to\nsubstantial issues of women\u2019s rights, or to supporting the case of an oppressed woman against her\nhusband and family members, khap Panchayats almost always take the patriarchal view. So when\nit comes to crimes committed in the name of \u201chonour,\u201d a term the onus of preserving which\nis exclusively rested on the shoulders of the women in society, the khaps demonstrate a\ntypical patriarchal mind set.\nThe right to love and live with a person of one\u2019s choice is a fundamental right that is\nenshrined in the Constitution. Each murder, therefore, signifies the victory of primitive customs\nover a modern, liberal and democratic society. The killings also strengthen the hand of a sinister\nagency, which has demonized concepts as natural as love and affection. Killing in the name of\nhonour is a fairly common and even accepted phenomenon in the areas which have been a part of\nthe study. A very consistent response about such killings is the categorical denial of the\ninvolvement of khap in any honour killing. It is the family which is involved in killings done\nin the name of honour. The fact that if the family doesn\u2019t itself kill for honour, it would face\nsocial ostracization is a different issue altogether.\nAs far the role and responsibilities of authorities, throughout the study/survey one most\nimportant aspect which was highlighted strikingly, was the police officials defence that unless\nsomebody complains or informs them, they are not authorized to take suo moto action. In this\nregard, it is suggested that the role and responsibilities of the officials which are ambiguous should\nbe made more clear and special police team/unit should be designated to take action in such type\nof cases where no complain has been made and the occurrence of any such type of case is brought\nto notice of officials by media reports or otherwise. One reason for the inaction on the part of\nthe police officials could very well be the political protection afforded to the khaps. As long\n97\nas the khaps are politically protected, the police officials would continue to function in the\nshadow of fear of social and political implications.\nDuring the interviews and discussion with the field investigators (In the state of\nHaryana, U.P.(West) and Rajasthan) most of the police officials on the promise of\nconfidentiality of their identity, justified the suppression of girls and honour killings. They\nsaid they are also the members of the same society and before being the officials they are first the\nson of that family, so they have the same value system. Such an attitude reflects the impact of\nculture that has conditioned the minds of these men to accept the superiority of men over\nwomens\u2019 bodies and the suppression of womens\u2019 liberty as a matter of right.\nWhat can be done to bring about change is a major challenge we face as a society on a\nwhole. The change cannot be sudden but it has to be gradual which is happening as can be\ninferred by interacting with the youth. Most of the youth especially boys who are pursuing higher\neducation and are witnessing the outside world, such boys who are going to be the heads of the\nfamilies tomorrow. During discussion with these boys, the observation and inference of the\nresearcher is that they will defy such derogatory and discriminatory practices. Most of them\nbelieve, having less children, is the key to such a change. They want their children to be\nhighly and professionally educated, even if it is a daughter. For them it doesn\u2019t make them any\ndifference whether it\u2019s a girl or boy. 112\nHowever, the moment, you ask them about the derogatory practicing happening in their\nsurroundings with their sisters, mothers, wives, they keep quiet as they are not in a position to\nchange anything and out of respect they cannot speak anything against their elders even if they\ndon\u2019t agree with them. Thus we see the change has started to begin which is very slow and gradual\nespecially. Such a change has to be promoted by further education of the youth.\nEducation is also the cure for declining sex ratio. If girls are educated, self-sufficient and\nnot a burden either on parents or on in laws; the issue of female feticide will gradually disappear.\nWith the passage of time, the trend of having not more than two children and making them highly\n112 Further gender sensitisation at primary level can further bring about major changes in overall situation of the\nwomen in the society.\n98\neducated, later both the children making their own destiny, for parents it will become immaterial\nwhether the child is a girl or a boy.\nAnother stark reality that was highlighted during the study was the patriarchal mindset for\nboys as the successor of property. The son is the real \u201cwaaris\u201d or inheritor and the daughter is\n\u2018paraya dhan.\u2019 The men justify not giving any share in property to their womenfolk, as being the\ncustodians/guardians they have to bear all the customary expenses of the daughter/sister, namely\ndahej, bhaath, chuchak etc. Also, women do not see any point in claiming their share in the\nproperty because they know they won\u2019t get anything and relationships would be soured\nunnecessarily within the family leading to a certain kind of social ostracism (the fear of being\nlabelled a \u201cdayan\u201d or a witch who eats her brothers\u2019 property).\nProperty it appears is the root cause of discrimination faced by women. The demand to ban\nmarriages within the same sub-caste, and within the same village, or not allowing the women to\nchoose their own partners isn\u2019t only about preserving some part of tradition, it is also about\nseeking to control bodies and curbing basic human and individual freedom and liberty and most\nimportantly seeking control of the property that might go out of reach if the woman dare to choose\nher partner of own choice. The men in the family feel that if women are given their due share, they\nwill become a threat to their power.\nWhile talking about the role and responsibilities of the authorities, a question that\nnaturally comes to one\u2019s mind is State Women Commissions role. Despite the fact that a state\nwomen\u2019s commission exists in each state, still there is so no upliftment in the status of\nwoman, it is also a matter of further research.\nCombating such discrimination, cannot be solely about implementing the law. The political\nclass, as part of the project of enabling that social transformation must also seek to engage these\ncaste formations and their defenders. That all tradition isn\u2019t good or even that it can\u2019t remain\nossified and has to evolve and absorb the rights and laws of a democratic age, is a concept that\nmust be embedded in society at large. But solely banking on the political class for bringing about\nchange would be rather unrealistic keeping in mind the caste and vote bank politics played in the\nrural and semi urban areas. What is required is mass education campaign on the part of the state\n99\nmachinery, educating the masses of human rights and inculcation of values which help in doing\naway with the discrimination against women and encourage equality at all levels.\nA caste Panchayat has no legitimacy in the eyes of the law. It is not an inclusive agency\nand hence cannot have a role to play in an egalitarian society. But discarding it completely\nwithout bringing about social transformation would pose dangerous results. What is the need of\nthe hour is creation of mass awareness through education. Mandatory education on gender\nissues, gender sensitization through mass education campaign by the state is what is required to\ncombat the evils of gender discrimination. The patriarchal mindset that revels in unnecessary\nhype of \u201chonour\u201d residing in womens\u2019 bodies can only be changed through the light of education.\nEducation is the most potent tool for socio-economic mobility and a key instrument for building an\nequitable and just society and is the only means of bridging the gap between gender inequality.\nSince the solution to all the problems leads to one solution- education, it becomes\nimportant for us to ask that why despite the constitutional guarantee of free and compulsorily\neducation as fundamental right there is such dearth of education and schools. As it was observed in\nMewat (Haryana), where girls don\u2019t go to school because of the non-availability of the same.\nBefore 1976, education was the exclusive responsibility of the States, it was the\nConstitutional Amendment of 1976, which included education in the concurrent List. The\nsubstantive, financial and administrative implication required a new sharing of responsibility\nbetween the Union Government and the States. While the role and responsibility of the States in\neducation remained largely unchanged, the Union Government accepted a larger responsibility of\nreinforcing the national and integrated character of education, maintaining quality and standard\nincluding those of the teaching profession at all levels, and the study and monitoring of the\neducational requirements of the country. The Constitution (Eighty-sixth Amendment) Act, 2002\ninserted Article 21-A in the Constitution of India to provide free and compulsory education of all\nchildren in the age group of six to fourteen years as a Fundamental Right in such a manner as the\nState may, by law, determine. The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE)\nAct, 2009, which represents the consequential legislation envisaged under Article 21-A, means\nthat every child has a right to full time elementary education of satisfactory and equitable quality\nin a formal school which satisfies certain essential norms and standards. Article 21-A and the RTE\nAct came into effect on April 1, 2010.\n100\nIn order to achieve UEE (Universalisation of Elementary Education), the Government of\nIndia has initiated a number of programmes and projects. The following Centrally sponsored\nprogrammes113 are being implemented in the Education Sector under Ministry of Human Resource\nDevelopment:-\n\u2022 Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan(SSA)\n\u2022 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya\n\u2022 National Programme for Education of Girls at Elementary Level (NPEGEL)\n\u2022 Mid Day Meal Scheme(MDMS)\n\u2022 Mahila Samakhya\n\u2022 Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan(RMSA)\n\u2022 Scheme for setting up of 6000 Model Schools at Block level as Benchmark of\nExcellence\n\u2022 Scheme for construction and running of Girls Hostel for Secondary and Higher\nSecondary Schools\n\u2022 Adult Education and Skill Development Scheme\n\u2022 Scheme for Providing a Quality Education in Madarsas (SPQEM)\n\u2022 Scheme for Infrastructure Development in Minority Institutions (IDMI)\n\u2022 National Scheme for Incentive to the Girl Child for Secondary Education.\nThousands of Crores of rupees have been allocated for the implementation of these\nschemes by the Central Government. Provisions of Right to Education Act are being implemented\nthrough Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. Accordingly, norms have been revised / modified to align them\nwith the requirement of Right to Education Act, 2009.\nKasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya are residential upper primary schools for girls from SC,\nST, OBC and Muslim communities. KGBVs are set up in areas of scattered habitations where\nschools are at great distances and are a challenge to the security of girls. This often compels girls\nto discontinue their education. KGBV addresses this through setting up residential schools, in the\nblock itself. KGBVs provide for a minimum reservation of 75 per cent seats for girls from\nSC/ST/OBC and minorities communities and 25 per cent to girls from families that live below the\n113 Reference Note no 17/ RN/ Ref./ August/2013, Lok Sabha Secretariat, Parliament Library And Reference,\nResearch, Documentation And Information Service (LARRDIS) available at\nhttp://164.100.47.134/intranet/FinalGovernmentSchemesforSchoolEducation.pdf.\n101\npoverty line. Till 2009-10 there were 2570 KGBVs in the country. After the RTE Act came into\noperation, an additional 1030 KGBVs were sanctioned. How successfully these Vidyalayas have\nworked to reach is to be seen.\nWith thousands of crores sanctioned to so many educational schemes, it is a matter of\nfurther research as to why despite the constitutional guarantee of free and compulsory\neducation and so many attempts on the part of the State to promote education why even\nprimary education is missing in many parts of the country also where existing the level of\neducation in India is not up to the mark.\nHowever, having highlighted the importance of education in bringing about changes in the\nmindset of the masses, it is submitted that since change through mass education program cannot\nbe brought overnight, we need a law to at least put a leash on the crimes which are committed\nagainst women in the name of honour. It is being strongly felt that there should be a strict and\ndeterrent law to deal with honour killings/honour crimes. For effective implementation, the law is\nrequired to be supplemented by social mobilization to deal with such crimes.\nThe honour killing should be specifically and separately defined for proper action.\nPresently, there is no separate data on honour killing cases. If honour killing is made a separate\noffence it will bring clarity for the law enforcement agencies\nAlso it is proposed that the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 should be amended so as to shift\nburden of proof to the accused in honour killing cases. The new law should provide a mandate for\nspecial police cell in each district to provide protection to couples and institutional machinery is\nalso required for co-ordination of all stake holders. Special fast track courts should be constituted\nfor handling cases of honour killings. There should be a joint liability principle i.e., the Khap\nPanchayat or any group ordering honour killing and the person who carries out the killing would\nbe jointly liable for punishment. As highlighted by the study, it is the family that kills for honour,\nimposition of joint liability on the khaps even when they don\u2019t order any killing, should work to\nensure that the khaps to avoid any criminal prosecution prevents any such killing or crime\ncommitted in the name of honour.\n102\nANNEXURE\nSTATE OF HARYANA\nCase study 1.\nMr. Jaitirathdhaiya (MLA, sonipat)\nGender: male\nAge: around 60\nAs we further moved in our journey we entered Sonepath at (Rai), where we met Mr.\nJaiteerath presently (MLA). Whereby Dr. Nuzhat Parveen Khan had a discussion with him\nregarding various issues, following are the questions and answers recorded:\nQuestion 1. Is there any formal method of electing khaps?\nAnswer 1. No, there is no particular way of electing khap. When a panchayat is of particular\ncaste and reputed members of that caste come together to discuss and decide on particular\nissue it\u2019s called khap. eg. dhaiyakhap, kashyapkhap Malik khap etc to name a few.\nQuestion 2. Why khap system is famous?\nAnswer 2. He told khap is a famous system since ancient time, and even today people of\nHaryana believe in it, they believe it\u2019s a body which always guides about social issues in\nright manner. Members are hereditary. There are many customs developed gradually through\nthis body which are beneficial for society, like\n\u2022 Taking minimum members in gathering (barat) in marriage from boy\u2019s side.\n\u2022 Not taking Dowry more than Rs.1.\n\u2022 No marriage in same gotra.\nQuestion 3. Do Panchayat have authority to order honour killing?\nAnswer 3: Certainly not, panchayat is merely an advisory body, it only tells what is right\nreligiously. Whatever honour killing instances has taken place, always it\u2019s the family\nmember who have taken this step, khap never orders such things.\nQuestion 4: Are women members of khap?\n103\nAnswer 4. Women are never members of khaps, in fact in Haryana women even cast their\nvote during election on advice of male member of family, because it\u2019s the male who have to\ngo out and deal with people, so he is the better judge of who shall form government.\nQuestion 5. What is the status of children born out of wedlock?\nAnswer 5. Firstly such wedlock\u2019s are not permitted, but if the marriage takes place they face\nboycott from family as well as community, but children born out of wedlock are called\nlegitimate.\nQuestions 6.What are the property rights of women?\nAnswer 6. Women get equal share in property which they generally relinquish at time of\ntheir marriage.\nQuestion 7. If they want to take it?\nAnswer 7. Usually it does not happen, but if some greedy girl wants to take it then she loses\nlove, affection and support from her parents and brother.\nFinally this session with Mr Jaiteerath finished on this note.\n1. SONIPAT (KAKROI)\nCase study- 2\nMahender Singh (progressive farmer and social activist)\nGender: male\nAge: 76\nNow we moved to Kakroi village where we were going to meet Mr Mahendrasingh who had\ngiven property to her daughter, and taken a lot of effort to educate his daughter, she lives in\nNew Zealand. Again he was interviewed by Dr. Nuzhat Parveen Khan on various women\nrelated issues, and role of khap in society.\nQuestion 1. Do you educate girls?\nAnswer 1. Yes, certainly we send our daughters to school. But over all education system has\ndeteriorated in India. The whole system is corrupt. Families send daughters for mid day\nmeal, and many a times don\u2019t provide education resources to daughters.\n104\nHe told an instance that once a group of girls came to him, with a problem that the auto\nriksha fare has increased from Rs.7 to Rs.12 and it was becoming difficult for them to go\nschool. As they are girls and very limited pocket money is given to them where as boys\ndon\u2019t face such problem. This shows the motivation level of parents to educate daughters.\nQuestion 2. Is there problem of female foeticide in village?\nAnswer 2. Because everyone adopt wrongful means to get feotes sex tested, if its girl they\nget it aborted.\nQuestion 3.Then why girl child ratio is so low in your state?\nAnswer 3. Because its old believe that girl has to finally go to other family, there are many\nresponsibilities attached. Even every mother\u2019s first desire is to have son.\nQuestion 4.Why such kind of feeling, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s wrong?\nAnswer 4. Yes, such feelings should change, girls are equally valuable. In fact boys many a\ntimes mistreat parents but girls never do that, even when they get married they try to\nmaintain balance.\nQuestion 5. Do you have a daughter?\nAnswer 5. Yes. I have one daughter and two sons. Among all, my daughter is most educated.\nShe always wanted to pursue higher studies, for which I had sent her to Russia to study\nmedicine, but as the climate of that place didn\u2019t suit to her she had to return early, and then\nshe studied medicine from India. Now she lives in New Zealand, she visits us each year and\ncontributes in development of our family.\nQuestion 6. Have you given her share of property?\nAnswer 6. Yes, I have given property to her. Even after her marriage it is in her name.\nQuestion 7. Do you think decisions given by khap are correct?\nAnswer 8. If we see our culture, certainly decision given by khaps is good, as they are for\nsocial stability.\nOUTCOME OF THE INTERVIEW\nThose who are in powerful position act normally, their rules are run only on the people who\ncan be suppressed and subordinated.\n105\nFurther we interviewed daughter in Law of Mr Mahender Singh, she was sitting with her\nteenager son. Generating a discussion with young boy the researcher asked him, what is he\nstudying, what does he want to become, how many brothers and sisters does he have, Again\nin this family only two boys. Though we wanted to talk to her and her son but Mr Mahender\nSingh came and sat there only. Following are some questions which I asked her\nQuestion 1. Are girls sent to school and colleges?\nAnswer1. Yes, girls are sent to school and colleges.\nQuestion 2. Do you support khaps?\nAnswer 2. Yes, khaps constitute reputed member of society and they decide rightly on some\nimportant aspects of life.\nQuestion 3. Why is female feoticide so prevalent in Haryana?\nAnswer 3. No Answer\nQuestion 4. What is the position of women in Haryana?\nAnswer 4. It is fine.\nOBSERVATION OF THE INTERVIEW\nWomen are generally suppressed and not allowed to speak.\nLater we moved to village Tihada, where we generated FGD with a group of women varying\nfrom age group of 20 to 70 years.\n2. SONIPAT (TIHADA)\nCase study- 3\nPerson in FGD (focussed group discussion): all females of various age groups\nQuestion 1. They were asked how khap panchayat respond to their problems.\nAnswer 1. They told khap panchayat address social problems based on custom practiced\nfrom long time.\nQuestion 2. Do girls go to school and later to college?\n106\nAnswer 2. Very few girls go to the schools and colleges, as they have to help in household\nchores as mothers go to the field.\nQUESTION 4 Do you want your daughter should go to school\nQuestion 3. Why there is more female foeticide?\nAnswer 4. Girls are seen as a burden on the family therefore, nobody wants them.\nQuestion 4. Do you get right in property?\nAnswer 4. As such girls are given rights in property. But we have to relinquish it at time of\nmarriage.\nQuestion 5. If you don\u2019t relinquish it what happens?\nAnswer 5. If girl takes her property, her parents as well as siblings boycott her as they\nbelieve that she has gone against society norms.\nQuestion 6. Do you get your husband\u2019s property in name?\nAnswer 6. No, husband gives monetary support but doesn\u2019t give property in name of the\nwife.\nQuestion 7. Do you think you should get the share in property?\nAnswer 7. Certainly our share shall be given in our name. Otherwise we would not get any\nmental peace and would always be worried about our economic condition. There is nothing\nin our name and we remain dependent on our husband, even after working.\nQuestion 8. What type of work you do?\nAnswer 8.We manages whole agriculture, animal rearing and house hold as well. Many men\nhere simply play cards, drink alcohol and are living on the work of female.\nQuestion 9. Do you earn out of your work, if not, who keeps it?\nAnswer 9. Yes, we earn out of our work but generally husband takes that money as a right,\nthey always want to make us financially dependent on them.\nQuestion 10. Do these Panch work for your welfare?\nAnswer 10. Some time they certainly work for the welfare, but many times very important\nproblems are not addressed by them, like we have asked them to provide a doctor in the\nvillage, as there is no doctor over here and especially in time of delivery we face grave\nproblems. At least a trained nurse should be present here.\n107\nQuestion 11. Do you vote?\nAnswer 11. Yes, we vote.\nQuestion 12. How you decide whom to vote?\nAnswer 12. We vote to those whom our husband says.\nAfter this discussion we moved to Panipath our next destination. There firstly we went to\nvillage UJHAA\n3. PANIPAT (UJHAA)\nHere our interview was scheduled with sarpanch of Village who was a lady. As we went to\ntheir house, husband of that lady came; he said his wife is busy in some household work so\nhe will talk of her behalf. Dr. Nuzhat Parveen asked certain questions to\u2026.\nCase study 4\nResearch methodology: interview method\nQuestion1. What are khaps?\nAnswer 1. Khaps are caste based panchayat, which decides on various social issues for\npeople welfare.\nQuestion 2. What is condition of female in society?\nAnswer 2. It\u2019s good\nQuestion 3.Why is problem of female foeticide so rampant in Haryana?\nAnswer 3. No, there is no female foeticide.\nQuestion 4. What is gotra?\nAnswer 4. It\u2019s like belonging to same family, in which yours, your mother\u2019s, your\ngrandmother\u2019s gotra marriage is prohibited.\nQuestion 5. If someone does that marriage, what is the attitude of khap?\nAnswer5. Khaps are merely advisory body, moreover the family of the married couple, for\ntheir honour suo moto decides the punishment.\n108\n\u2022 Which is sometimes boycott?\n\u2022 Sometimes honour killings.\nQuestion 6. What are the property rights of female?\nAnswer 6. Girls get an equal share in the property which she generally relinquishes before\nher marriage.\nQuestion 7. If she wishes to take the share in the property?\nAnswer 7. She can take it, but she will lose love and affection from her parents and brothers.\nQuestion 8. If there are only daughters, then what happens.\nAnswer 8. Then parents shall adopt son.\nQuestion 9. If they don\u2019t adopt a son?\nAnswer 9. At the wish and will of parents it can be given to girls. If she wants to keep good\nrelation with family of chachaetc she can give it to her cousin male men.\n4. Adbar (Mewat)\nFemales in the village were all generally of the view that girls can work at home as ladies\nhave to go to the fields.\nINTERVIEW WITH VILLEGE GIRL\nRespondent 1\nNAME: SHAMIMA\nAGE: 17\nQUESTION 1.

UDRAMSAR, BIKANER (majority caste-Yadav (Ahir))\nCase study 5\nSarpanch\nHemantYadav\nQuestion1. What is the response of inter caste marriage in your society?\nAnswer 1.

What do you think are the major reasons inter caste marriage have took place?\nAnswer 4. I think development of education and more use of technology has encouraged\nmore inter-caste marriage. Children get educated and then they don\u2019t respect\ntheir customs and culture which forbids them to marry a person of some other\ncaste. They are sent to study and not to love somebody. By getting into all these\nthings they break out the trust and in addition hurt their parents to the extent that\nparent\u2019s reputation among the society is damaged. The advancement in IT sector\nhas led to chatting and web calling etc. this in turn corrupts the mind of children\nleading them to get involved in craps like love marriages.\nQuestion 5. Why are you so against the inter-caste marriages? What is the harm in\nmarrying inter-caste?\nAnswer 5. People are reluctant to inter-caste marriages because these \u201crules\u201d are followed\nsince long time and this forms a custom and these customs cannot be deviated with,\nmoreover our elders were not fools that they made these rules, rather they were more\nknowledgeable and smarter than us and all these rules have a definite logic behind them.\n2.

JODHPUR\nCase study 8\nRespondent: Dinesh Godara (Advocate Jodhpur High Court)\nQuestion 1. What is your view on inter-caste marriage?\nAnswer 1. There are few instances of violence pertaining to inter-caste marriages are seen in\nBharatpur (a District in eastern Rajasthan) area where unrecognized Panchayats (probably\nKhap Panchayats) order the community members to outcaste the couples or the female and\ncertain fine to be imposed if anybody talks to them. Even the family members have to\ndisown them else they shall also face the same. In Urban areas otherwise only the family\n122\nmembers react to such issues and in few cases violence is seen, most of them are accepted\nafter some time.\n5. HIMMATPURA, JODHPUR\n(Rajput Majority Village)\nSarpanch: Unavailable\nRespondent: Chain Singh(educated elder member of society)\nQuestion1. Why there is so violent and bad response to inter-caste marriage?\nAnswer 1. The girl represents the reputation of the community and she marrying to a boy of\nanother caste is like making fun of the community (slang used). Killing them brings nothing\nback but at least creates a sense of fear among the others to not to dare sell out the reputation\nof their caste/community in the world. According to him killing is the least punishment one\ncan have as it gives them moksha, they are supposed to be treated as animals (slang used)\nbecause their act is no less than an animal act. According to him this is kalyug (the last phase\nof the world-as per Hindu mythology) and there is going to be no rebirth and everybody has\nto pay for their sins in this yug (phase) only and such marriages are no less than a sin. Lastly\nhe said people like me who have got educated should try to make the authorities understand\nthe relevance of caste system and customs should be given prevalence over anything and it is\nthe law of the nature and should not be deviated with.\n6. GUMANPURA, JODHPUR\n(Rajput Majority Village)\nRespondent 1.\nSarpanch\nQuestion1. What is your view on inter- caste marriage?\nAnswer 1. Nowadays parents mostly accept inter-caste marriage, there is no punchayat much\nrequired.\nRespondent 2.\nSchool teacher (science)\n123\nQuestion 1. What is your view on inter-caste marriage?\nAnswer 1. First of all the word inter caste in itself doesn\u2019t exist. She believes that all\nhumans are same. Caste system started on the basis of karma (work) but latter transformed\nits basis being by birth which is wrong. Inter caste marriages are good for the growth of\nsociety, and nations. Love marriages are mostly inter-caste marriages. If there is complete\nharmony, faith, sustenance power, patience and understanding between the couple, there is\nno harm in this kind of marriage. They should be ready to face the opposition of family and\nsociety and independent too. Such marriages are good for their offspring. Heredity illness\nbecomes lesser in them. By this dowry system can be finished, lesser cases for dowry\nharassments. Castiesm will be affected too; people will be more human and global. This is\nhow humans get wider paths and not being narrow minded. This is how society grows up\nand then the nation.\n124"

Once these cases were collected, the task\nwas there for conducting a content analysing for preparing the tables under the\nsupervision of Mr. Sukant Chandra Behera, Team Lead, Programme Development and\nImplementation, NACDOR.\nSimple tables tell us a lot, but in order to have a cogent understanding of the data and\nfindings in the table and description of the table is very important along with narrating\nthe context of the table, assessing the policy initiatives, report on the legal provisions,\nawareness programme, bringing out the stories of pain and anguish, feeling them and then\ndrafting the recommendations as per the guidelines. The first version of the report\nkeeping in consideration all the parameters was done by the Ms. Madhusmita Mohanty,\nConsultant, Reasearch and Documentation, CADAM and NACDOR. We are indebted to Mr.\nAshok Bharti, Chairman of National Confederation of Dalit Organisations (NACDOR) who\nconceived the programme for eliminating violence against Dalit women through\neliminating ignorance and then then through producing knowledge products that are\nhelpful in building policy for eliminating violence against Dalit and Adivasi women through\naccusing them of being a Witch.\nCommon sense wisdom for debunking the idea that some could be witch was apt when an\nNGO leader said \u2018Ojha is Bojha\u2019 considering the fact that some of the psychological\nproblems or illness that could not be treated by him or some of the deaths that were not\nexplained by him were attributed to witch in order to give and answer. We are indebted\nto NGOs leaders and police personnel who cooperated in the investigation giving out a\nclear picture of their understanding on the issue sharing their reports and experience in\n5 | Page\ndealing with the incidence of violence through witch-hunting.

They are one of the largest\nsocially segregated groups anywhere in the world, and make up 2 per cent of the world\u2019s\ntotal population. Dalit women constitute half of 200 million Dalit populations, and 16.3 of\nthe total Indian female population. Dalit women are placed at the absolute bottom of the\nsocial hierarchy as they face systemic and structural discrimination threefold: as Dalits, as\npoor, and as women. The caste system, estimated to affect 260 million people globally,\ndeclares Dalit women to be intrinsically impure and \u2018untouchable\u2018, which sanctions social\nexclusion and exploitation. The vast majority of Dalit women are poor; they are landless\nwage labourers and lack access to basic amenities and entitlements. They are subjugated\nby patriarchal structures, both in the general community and within their own family.\nAlthough, the traditional taboos are similar for both Dalit men and women, but Dalit\nwomen bear the burden more often. Moreover, men are dominant in Dalit communities.\nDalit women are subjected to inhumane living conditions and human rights violations;\ndiscrimination and violence systematically deny them opportunities, choices and freedoms\nin all spheres of life. This undermines not only their dignity and self-respect, but also their\nrights to equality and development. Dalit women also have less power within the Dalit\nmovement itself. Women are active in large numbers in the movement but most\nleadership positions in the organizations, local bodies and associations have until now\nbeen held by men. Dalit women are discriminated in economic, socio-cultural, political\nand legal spheres. Such deprivation and discrimination against Dalit women presents clear\nevidence of widespread exploitation and violence against these women subordinated in\nterms of power relations to men in a patriarchal society, as also against their communities\nbased on caste.\nViolence against women is the most pervasive yet under recognized human rights violation\nin the world. This includes domestic violence, polygamy, sexual harassment, rape,\nmolestation, kidnapping, abduction, homicide, physical and mental torture and trafficking\netc. As the National Commission for Women has commented, \u201cin the commission of\noffences against\u2026 scheduled caste [Dalit] women the offenders try to establish their\nauthority and humiliate the community by subjecting their women to indecent and\ninhuman treatment, including sexual assault, parading naked, using filthy language,\netc.\u201d.1 The National Crime Records Bureau data records reveal that more than four Dalit\nwomen are raped every day in India.2 According to the UN Declaration on the elimination\nof violence against Women 1993, VAW encompasses, but is not limited to physical, sexual,\nand psychological violence occurring in the family, including battering, sexual abuse of\nfemale children in the household, dowry related violence, marital rape, female genital\nmutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women. Hence, violence, which\nserves as a crucial social mechanism to maintain Dalit women\u2019s subordinate position in\n1 National Commission for Women, Women of Weaker Sections: Socio-Economic Development of Scheduled Caste\nWomen, New Delhi, 1996, p.33\n2 National Crime Records Bureau, Govt. of India. http://www.ncrb.gov.in/\n7 | Page\nsociety, is the core outcome of gender-based inequalities shaped and intensified by the\ncaste system.\nDalit /Scheduled caste (SC) women, in India\u2019s highly patriarchal and caste-based society,\nbear the triple burden of caste, class, and gender. Being positioned at the lowest social\norder of Indian society, Scheduled caste women suffer from multiple forms of\ndiscrimination, including lack of education, economic disadvantages, social\ndisempowerment, domestic violence, political invisibility, and sexual oppression. In\ncontravention of both national laws and international human rights standards that prohibit\nany physical, sexual or psychological violence against women, varying forms of violent acts\nspecifically targeting SC women are occurring on a large scale across India today. Witch-\nhunting is one of the heinous forms of violence that Dalit women are subjected to in India.\nThrough protective measures are there in place to punish those who commit violence\nagainst women in cases of witchcraft allegations, but they are still ineffective to protect\nmost women accused of witchcraft. With this background, the present study makes an\nattempt to explore the extent and nature of violence against Dalit women in the name of\nwitch-hunt in Bihar, Odisha and Jharkhand.\n1.2 Statement of the problem\n\"Witch craft is seen as a manifestation of evil believed to come from a human source\"\n(Kgatla et. al. 2003:5). Hence, accusations of being a 'witch' refers to the alleged\npossession by an evil spirit in a women (or much less often, a man) giving her supernatural\npowers to alter the course of nature. Likewise, witch-hunting is a 'search' for suspected\nwitches, who are believed to use witchcraft to harm people. After being accused, they are\ntortured and treated inhumanly by their communities and often by relatives. 'Witch-\nhunting' could be seen as one of the worst forms of cultural violence against women.\nWitchcraft in India is still part of the deep rooted traditional rural culture of India.\nViolence against women who are accused of being witches is generally present and\npervasive. This violence is so severe and dangerous; it results in the death of women who\nare accused. Hundreds of women in India\u2019s conservative villages have been killed or\ntortured after being accused of witchcraft. Those who survive are shunned and live in poor\nconditions. The accused women, primarily from Adivasi (tribal) and Dalit populations are\noften victims of land disputes or gender discrimination. A combination of poor health\nfacilities, illiteracy, and government corruption reinforces the customary influence of\nOjhas, traditional healers who also serve as mediators in village disputes. As important\nreligious, political and social figures, ojha legitimize witch hunts by confirming the\nsupposed involvement of witchcraft in any ill fortune.\nIn a country which ranks at 129 out of 146 in gender inequality index with a score of 0.6,\nthe highest in South Asia, each year an estimated 200 women are killed as witches in rural\nIndia. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, over 1791 women had died\nbetween 2001 and 2010 on account of black magic and witchcraft. According to the\nNational Crime Record Bureau (NCRB), 175 cases of witchcraft-related murders were\nreported in 2008 from various states, including Jharkhand, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh,\nOrissa, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.3 As per a study by an NGO, more than 2,500\n3 Ibid.\n8 | Page\nwomen were killed in the past 15 years in India after being accused of practicing\nwitchcraft.4 There is also research evidence suggesting that there has been a disturbing\nrise in Witch hunting cases in 2011. The rate of conviction in cases of crime against women\nis the lowest in India (26.9 %) when compared to other crimes and adding to this crisis is\nthe fact that there is no specific law in India to fight against witch hunting. Witch hunting\ncases are currently registered under sections 302 (murder), 320 (grievous hurt),\n351(Assault), 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty),\n364a (kidnapping for ransom) and 503 (criminal intimidation) (Ghosh, 2012; WGHR, 2012;\nHDR, 2011; NCRB, 2011; NAWO, 2006).\nAccording to Rebecca Vernon, the editor of the Cornell Law Journal \u201cOver the last fifteen\nyears, an estimated 2,500 Indian women have been killed because they were\n'witches...Witch hunts are most common among poor rural communities with little access\nto education and health services, and longstanding beliefs in witchcraft. When an\nindividual gets sick or harm befalls the community, the blame falls not upon a virus or\ncrop disease, but upon an alleged witch\u2019\u2019. Further, the Institute of Development Studies,\nreported that \"Poor, low-caste women are easy targets for naming/branding (as a\nwitch)...Women who are widowed, infertile, possess 'ugly' features or are old,\nunprotected, poor or socially ostracized are easy targets.\" said professor Kanchan Mathur,\nfrom the Institute of Development Studies \u2013 India, in a recent 2009 report. Women accused\nof witchcraft have been physically abused, ostracized and driven from their homes.\nThe practice of witch hunting in India is more prominent among the socially educationally\nexcluded Dalits and Adivasis who usually inhabit the secluded areas within the country\ncharacterized by limited access to livelihood opportunities. The practice of witchcraft in\nthe state of Odisha, Jharkhand and Bihar is present and pervasive despite having\nprotective measures and acts in place. \"The state of Jharkhand is deviating from\nInternational law obligations requiring India to address and prevent the problem of witch-\nhunting, which has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of women.\"5 Furthermore\n\u201cInternational courts mandate that this Court (High Court of Judicature, Jharkhand State,\nIndia) must take action to provide effective judicial remedies for violations of these\nintegral human rights,\" the appeal continues. Four states in India have approved\nprotective anti-witchcraft laws, but they are still ineffective to protect most women\naccused of witchcraft. Police protections, courtroom decisions and legal representations\nneed much more improvement. Education on the issues surrounding violence of women,\nsuperstitions and belief, along with greater understanding of equal human rights for\nwomen are essential to marking improvements.\nMoreover, the situation of Dalit is very critical. Due to patriarchal and caste based society\nand superstition they face multiple discrimination. Without comprehensive and carefully\n4 See more at: http://www.indianexpress.com/news/nhrc-seeks-actiontaken-report-on-assam-witchhunting-\ncases/792480/#sthash.LkdC4cKi.dpuf\n5 Cornell Law School International Human Rights Clinic, petition to the High Court of Judicature, Ranchi,\nJharkhand State, India \u2013 January 2010\n9 | Page\ndocumented research on violence against women in cases of witchcraft allegations, it is\nimpossible to know whether Dalit women are experiencing more violence in their\nhousehold or community, or whether they are reporting it more often. In the absence of\nproper research, it is difficult to compare and assess the scope of violence as well as the\neffectiveness of programmes to end it. Therefore, the study made an attempt to assess\nthe violence against Dalit women (VADW) in cases of witchcraft allegation. The study is\ndescriptive in nature. It explores the extent and nature of violence against Dalit women in\nthe name of witch-hunt and their perception to the violence.\n1.3 Rationale of the study\nThe focus of the paper is to analyze the phenomenon of 'witch hunting' in Odisha,\nJharkhand and Bihar as a manifestation of violence against women. The justification is\nthat women of all communities are facing violence but Dalit women are facing different\nforms of violence in domestic and social fronts besides their lower socio-economic and\neducational status.\nIndia is a multi-religious, multiethnic and multi-cultural country. In terms of human\ndevelopment indicators, it ranks 127 out of 177 countries (UNDP 2004). However,\npatriarchal system norms are also deeply embedded and women still face discrimination at\nvarious levels. The constitution of India states that no citizen shall be discriminated or\ndeprived of the right of equality and equal protection of law. But, the fact remains that\nthis is an illusion for many socially excluded women who are victimized by society.\nIncidents of violence against women are a normal feature of life. Rape incidents have also\nincreased and witch killing in indigenous communities are also another form of violence\nagainst women in India (Kelkar 1992). The Indian government has reported that from\ndowry harassment nearly 6,000 women a year die and many more are mutilated in India\n(Reddy 2002).\nSome empirical studies have also highlighted the incidents of witch hunting as a violation\nof women's rights and gender disparity. These studies show that women are vulnerable;\nespecially widows, single, poor and socially marginalised women. The absence of specific\nlaws to address this social evil has made it impossible to punish the perpetrators and seek\njustice for the victims of such abuses. However, there is a need to have a more\ntheoretically informed analysis of this phenomenon as well. This research paper will\nanalyze the actual ground situation with special reference to the states of Odisha,\nJharkhand and Bihar. This study seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of the\nphenomena of witch-hunting by studying cases and information. The study would allow\ninvestigation of the significance of culture vis-\u00e0-vis other factors, which may be the causes\nfor the prevalence/spread of 'witch hunting' in India.\n1.4 Objectives of the Study\nThe major objective of the study is to understand and conceptualize 'witch-hunting' as a\nform of violence against women in the contemporary era. For this, the study attempts to\ninvestigate the current situation of violence against women in the name of witch-hunting\nespecially focusing on Dalit women. The specific objectives are:\n10 | Page\n\u2022 To examine the nature and extent of violence against Dalit women in cases of\nwitchcraft allegation.\n\u2022 To explore and analyze the immediate causes/factors of such violence against Dalit\nwomen.\n\u2022 To analyze the debilitating effect of these customs and practices on women\u2019s\npsychological and the socio-economic well being.\n\u2022 To analyze the role of the family/community caste Panchayat and enforcement\nmachinery in preventing/ abetting these practices.\n\u2022 To examine the policy level initiatives\n1.5 Research Sample and Methodology\nThe present study is a descriptive research. The collection and analysis of data from\nvarious sources suitable to the context of violence against Dalit women due to witch\nallegation was done through primary and secondary sources. The primary data have been\ncollected through empirical surveys in the selected sample districts of selected sample\nstates. Both qualitative and quantitative methods have been adopted while collecting the\nprimary data.\n1.6 Limitations of the Study\nThe study through quantitative and qualitative assessment has endeavoured to capture the\nproblems at it exists and there are prescriptive propositions with acceptance of the human\nrights framework where each person has rights and duties. The qualitative data analysis\ncould have been more rigorous with generation of more data sets also sample size could\nhave been much bigger. However, religious and cultural setting being same across the\nstates with similar history, the findings to present a situation where interventions are\nneeded and shows the direction for the intervention of the multiple stakeholders that\nwould ensure zero incidence of violence against women generated as a result of the\naccusation for women and men of being a witch or someone casting evil spell. Case studies\nshows patterns of social transactions that result in violence and these abundantly shows\nhow local governance institution and police are responding to the incidence of violence\nagainst women as a result of accusation of being a witch.\nSampling\nThe present study was conducted in three selected sample states of Odisha, Jharkhand\nand Bihar. The states were selected on the basis of higher concentration of Dalit\npopulation to the total population. Moreover, the study was conducted in 12 backward\ndistricts of the states. The identification of districts was done on the basis of high\npercentage of Dalit population and having lower indicators of development. Furthermore,\nthe study was conducted in 98 villages of 21 blocks of the districts. The selected states\nand district is given in the following Table 1.1:\nTable \u2013 1.1 Sample Districts, Blocks and Villages\nState District Blocks Number of villages\nBihar Jahanabad Makhdumpur 8\nNalanda Biharsarif 1\nHilsa 16\nNawada Nawada 5\nRohtas Kargahar 1\n11 | Page\nSasaram 1\nSivsagar 1\nJharkhand Deoghar Deoghar 3\nFaron 3\nMadhupur 6\nMohanpur 6\nDumka Kathikund 4\nGiridih Giridih 14\nJamua 2\nHazaribagh Churchu 13\nKeridadi 1\nTatijharia 1\nOdisha Bhadrak Bhadrak 3\nGajapati Mahano 3\nKoraput Chandrapur 3\nSonepur Binka 3\nTotal 12 21 98\nDuring the selection of sample villages, adequate representation of different socio-\neconomic and demographic aspects like gender, caste, religion, occupation, education\nstatus, near to town and far from town, etc. were taken into consideration. The villages\nfor detailed study were identified in consultation with local government\nofficials/community leaders/social workers and Civil Society Organisations working in the\nareas.\nMethods of Data Collection\nIn order to collect primary data, 50 structured questionnaires were administered in each\ndistrict. The victims and their relatives, Panchayat leaders and local Ojhas were also\ninterviewed. The study conducted in-depth interviews of 5 women (Dalit) who are the\nvictim of witch-hunt in each district. It also included the people from the victim\u2019s\nneighbourhood. The questionnaires consist of both open ended and close-ended questions.\nA total of 12 focus group discussions were held separately with Dalit women, using semi\nstructured checklists. Each group consisted of about 10-12 persons. It involved women\ngroup leaders, CBOs leaders, members of Gram Panchayat and caste Panchayat and media\npersons. During the period of interview, some depth information about violence and, any\npertinent cases and, inhumane behaviour were also taken as a case study to complement\nthe set objective of this research. For each case study 5 persons such as Panchayat\nleaders, Local Ojhas, Caste Panchayat leaders and in-charge of the local police station\nwere interviewed and from each district at least two case studies were collected.\nFurthermore, the study involved discussions with individuals and community organizations\nwhich address problems of violence in the community. An analysis of the response to\nviolence of the Criminal Justice agencies and voluntary and statutory agencies was also\ndone. The total sample size consists of 1000 questionnaire, 50 in-depth interviews and 20\ncase studies.\nThe secondary sources of information involved critical review of statistical reports, annual\nreports, district and village development, women development office, profiles and plan\n12 | Page\ndocuments, Journal articles, and other published materials and official records of\nI/N/GOs. Finally, the data collected was analyzed using SPSS and Ms excels.\nLimitation of the Study\nThe study was conducted so as to find out the nature, extent and causes of violence\nagainst Dalit women in the name of witch-hunting and its mental and psychological\nimpacts. For this study, sample was selected from 12 backward districts of India and so,\nthe findings cannot be used to generalize to outside area. The research was done\nqualitatively than quantitatively. Thus, the findings of this study would be helpful for\ninitiating a step to make people aware for stopping any forms of violence against women\nin a wider scale.\n1.5 Organization of the Report\nWitch hunts in contemporary India occur primarily among the tribal populations of Andhra\nPradesh, Bihar, Orissa, West Bengal and Jharkhand. While there are a few studies on the\nwitch hunts in these states (Barman, 2002; Chaudhuri, 1981; Mishra, 2003; Nathan et al.,\n1998), witch hunts, particularly among the Dalit communities, are neglected issues among\nboth policy makers and academic scholars. The Dalits are the most socially, economically\nand educationally discriminated and exploited sections of the society. Accusation and\npersecution of witch hunts are common among them, and it is particularly interesting to\nstudy the factors responsible. On the other hand, witches are viewed as \u201cdeviant\u201d in the\ncaste social structure as they are considered to cause harm to the community. The most\ninteresting thing is that it is practiced covertly in the society. And, the perpetrators or\nvictims are chastised by their own community members without the knowledge of the\nauthorities. Thus, in order to have a detailed and better understanding of the study, the\nreport is structured as follows:\nIn Chapter II, a detailed conceptual framework of the problem is discussed. In other\nwords, a review of the existing literatures or theories related to witch hunting has been\ninitiated.\nIn Chapter III, the socio-historical and demographic setting of the study area and the\npeople is elucidated.\nIn Chapter IV, the nature and extent of the perception of the Dalits relating to presence of\nwitches and witch craft, the effects of such practices and the treatment involved has been\ndiscussed.\nIn Chapter V, the type and severity of violence against the Dalit women alleged of witches\nand witch practices is elucidated.\nIn Chapter VI, the institutional mechanisms to address the issue of witch hunting in the\nvillages is illustrated.\nLastly, Chapter VII is the conclusion and discussion section of the report and it summarizes\nthe main findings and the implications of the study. It ends with some recommendations\nfor future policy initiatives.\n13 | Page\nCHAPTER - II\nREVIEW OF LITERATURE\n2.1 Brief History\nA \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d is a comment that damages or threatens to damage a specific person or\nentity's reputation or resources even if he/she is guilty. These often take the form of\npersonal threats or attacks and calls to action. Witch hunting is the act of unfairly\nsearching for and punishing people who are accused of having opinions that are believed\nto be dangerous or evil. Although the ideas of witchcraft and malicious witches are quite\nancient, the notion of the \u201cheretic witch\u201d who makes a pact with the Devil has dominated\nresearch on witch hunts. The literature on these witch hunts is heavily centred upon why\nthe victims are mostly women. One type of explanation focuses on witch hunts as an\nexpression of male hegemony with attacks directed at female cults, midwives and women\nhealers.\nSeveral centuries ago, many practicing Christians, and those of other religions, had a\nstrong belief that the Devil could give certain people known as witches the power to harm\nothers in return for their loyalty. A \"witchcraft craze\" rise through Europe from the 1300s\nto the end of the 1600s. Witch-hunts, especially in Central Europe, resulted in the trial,\ntorture, and execution of victims and about three-quarters of victims were women.\nArguably, neither before nor since have adult European women been selectively targeted\nfor such large-scale atrocities. The witch-hunts of early modern Europe took place against\na backdrop of rapid social, economic, and religious transformation.\nHowever, the original witch-hunts took place in America in the 17th century, most\nfamously in Salem, Massachusetts. These witch-hunts happened for various reasons and\nwere greatly influenced by the fear of devil. Young girls were usually thought to be\nwitches or under the control of evil spirits and the trials were held in such a way that it\nwas almost impossible for them to prove that they were not guilty. The Salem witch trials\noccurred in colonial Massachusetts between 1692 and 1693. As per the data, more than\n200 people were accused of practicing witchcraft and around 20 were executed.\nEventually, the colony admitted the trials were a mistake and compensated the families of\nthose convicted. Since then, the story of the trials has become synonymous with fear and\ninjustice, and it continues to entice the popular imagination more than 300 years later.\nThe pre-modern European and the colonial American witch hunts\nThe literatures on the witch hunts in Europe & America have concentrated mostly on\nreligious rebellion and inheritance conflicts. In all of these explanations, there is\nreference to the \u201cscapegoat\u201d (\u201cfemale witch\u201d) who was the victim of conflicts over\nproperty, religion, social status caused by epidemics or wars. Jenny Gibbons' (1998)\nanalysis ties the witch-hunts to other \"panics\" in early modern Europe: \u201cTraditional\nattitudes towards witchcraft began to change in the 14th century, at the very end of the\nMiddle-Ages. ... Early 14th century central Europe was seized by a series of rumour-panics.\nSome malign conspiracy (Jews and lepers, Moslems, or Jews and witches) was attempting\n14 | Page\nto destroy the Christian kingdoms through magic and poison. After the terrible devastation\ncaused by the Black Death [bubonic plague] (1347-1349), these rumours increased in\nintensity and focused primarily on the witches and \u2018plague-spreaders\u2019. Witchcraft cases\nincreased slowly but steadily from the 14th-15th century. The first mass trials appeared in\nthe 15th century. At the beginning of the 16th century, as the first shock-waves from the\nReformation hit, the number of witch trials actually dropped. Then, around 1550, the\npersecution skyrocketed. What we think of as \u2018the Burning Times\u2019 -- the crazes, panics,\nand mass hysteria -- largely occurred in one century, from 1550-1650. In the 17th century,\nthe Great Hunt passed nearly as suddenly as it had arisen. Trials dropped sharply after\n1650 and disappeared completely by the end of the 18th century\u201d. Gibbons' mention to\nthe Reformation reminds the clash between Catholicism and Protestantism, which\neventually led to panic and hyper-suspiciousness on the part of Catholic and Protestant\nauthorities alike. Nachman Ben-Yehuda (1980) writes, \"This helps us understand why only\nthe most rapidly developing countries, where the Catholic Church was weakest,\nexperienced a virulent witch craze (i.e., Germany, France, Switzerland). Where the\nCatholic Church was strong (Spain, Italy, Portugal) hardly any witch craze occurred ... the\nReformation was definitely the first time that the church had to cope with a large-scale\nthreat to its very existence and legitimacy.\" But Ben-Yehuda adds that \"Protestants\npersecuted witches with almost the same zeal as the Catholics ... Protestants and\nCatholics alike felt threatened.\" It is notable that the witch-hunts lost most of their\nmomentum with the end of the Thirty Years War (Peace of Westphalia, 1648), which gave\nofficial recognition and legitimacy to religious pluralism.\nIn the 20th century, the focus on the topic of witch hunting was paid during the 1990s\n(Barstow, 1995; Behringer, 2004; Briggs, 1996; Godbeer, 1994; Hill, 1997; Harley, 1990;\nKarlsen, 1998; Reis, 1997). However, momentum has been building since the 1970s with\nthe publication of important general studies by Alan MacFarlane (1970), Keith Thomas\n(1963) and John Demos (2008), to name just a few. New multidisciplinary approaches,\nincluding the New Social History, feminism, deconstruction, ethnographic and\nanthropological & sociological methods and literary criticism have contributed to\nuncovering the complexities of popular religion and understanding the experiences of the\npersecuted. Witch-hunt is one of the few topics of scholarly pursuit that can be correlated\nwith popular activity and interest. Furthermore, an examination of the historiography of\nwitch-hunt over the past years reveals a significant number of works that consider the\nintersection of witchcraft, witch-hunt and gender. This approach had its origins in such\npioneering books as Christina Lamer's (1981) \u201cThe Enemies of God\u201d and Carol Karlsen's\n(1998)\u201cThe Devil in the Shape of a Woman\u201d, which combined witch-hunt studies with\nwomen's studies approach and emerging feminist theories. In some cases, applying these\ntheories has proven especially instructive in exploring such questions as why women were\nthe great majority of those accused of and executed for witchcraft during the past\ncenturies. Moving chronologically and from European historiography to American, this\nessay will provide a summary and analysis of selected studies from the past decade that\ndeal, either totally or in part, with witch-hunt and gender in the early modern period and\nthat are representative of several current avenues of inquiry. On one hand, the European\nwriters who used advanced applications of feminist theory were mostly traditional,\nanthropologically based scholars as well as those sympathetic to a feminist approach but\nintent on historical context and on the other hand, the American scholars, in the wake of\n15 | Page\nsynthetic works such as those by Karlsen (1998) and Demos (2008) with the recent\npublication of new documents.\nFor instance, Karlsen (1998) argues that economic factor, especially New England\u2019s system\nof inheritance, provides clues about the special positions of most accused witches\u2019 vis-\u00e0-\nvis their society\u2019s rules for transferring wealth from one generation to another. Most\naccused women had no legitimate male heirs in their immediate families and therefore\nstood to inherit or did inherit the property left by their father or husband. These women\nwere aberrations in a society with an inheritance system designed to keep property in the\nhands of men. Continuing the gender frame of analysis to witch hunts, Barstow (1994)\nattributes witch hunts to competition between men and women during changing economic\nand political conditions in pre modern Europe. The witch hunts took place at the same\ntime as colonization\u2019s and the slave trade, and according to Barstow, all three were made\npossible by the same \u201cecclesiastical policies and legal changes.\u201d Barstow and Hester\n(1992) focused on specifically the sexual and dynamic, process whereby men have, and\nmaintain, dominance over women. The practice of witch-hunting provided a platform for\ndemonstrating this power relation, in which sexuality is the \"central dynamic\" by which\nmen retain dominance. In some instances, Barstow explains, wealthy women were\nattacked. This was typical in the later years of the witch hunt, at a time when poor\nwomen victims were depleted or when the poor women sort revenge by naming well-to-do\nwomen. Between 1550 and 1700, Barstow states, women became \"marginal workers\" as a\nresult of which there was rise of a male medical profession and new Christian ideologies.\nWomen were hereby deprived of their traditional roles as healers and \"wise women\". In\nthis context, Hester writes, the witch-hunts were \"one means of controlling women\nsocially within a male supremacist society, using violence or the threat of violence, and\nrelying on a particular construct of female sexuality\". This construct was of women as\n\"passive\" and \"domesticated,\" in order to curb their more sexual, emotional, and therefore\nmore irrational natures. These attributed traits made woman, as Fraser (1984) has put it,\n\"the weaker vessel.\"\nIn addition to gender and economy, Karlsen (1998) brings in a third factor tied to the\nprevious two in her analysis: religion. According to Karlsen, the New England settlers also\ncarried with them a dual conception of witchcraft and the menace i.e. witches were not\nonly threats to their neighbours\u2019 physical and economic well-being, but were heretics.\nWitchcraft was viewed as rebellion against God. The constant fear was about the Devil\u2019s\nsuccess in recruiting people to help destroy Puritan churches. Women healers, who aided\nduring illnesses and child birth procedures, were common targets during witch hunts.\nBarstow (1994) writes that a typical witch in Europe was a woman who possessed the\npower of healing a power that everyone believed was also the power to kill.\nHowever, the late Sigrid Brauner's (1995) work does not merely present gendered\nexplanations for why women were thought to be witches but actually traces the shifting\ndefinitions of both witch hunt and gender in order to explain how women came to be more\nsusceptible to accusation. Her work explores \"the issue of gender in the conception of the\nmodern witch\" by deconstructing learned and vernacular literatures in order to discover\n\"social stereotypes of women\". The definition of the witch and of gender identity both\n16 | Page\nchanged in the beginning of sixteenth century. Previously, a man could be in league with\nthe devil as easily as a woman, and devils themselves could be female as often as male.\nMoreover, in the wake of religious reformation and the emergence of urban capitalism,\nmedieval assumptions about husbands and wives being interdependent in domestic\nconcerns and in earning income started to give way to a complementary view. In this, the\nhusband and wife had separate spheres of responsibility and the wife was obliged to\nsubject herself to her husband in virtually all matters. Brauner draws on three sixteenth-\ncentury writers-Martin Luther, Paul Rebhun, and Hans Sachs to show how Protestants\nevolved a \"new set of moral and religious values derived from the Lutheran concept of\nmarriage\". Central to this concept was that women were to marry and be devoted to\nhouse-work. Any woman who did not conform to this new standard was disobedient to\nGod. In contrast to Catholic demonologists like Heinrich Kramer and James Sprenger, 1971\n(\u201cThe Malleus Maleficarum\u201c) who concluded that women were driven to witchcraft\nbecause of their rapacious sexual natures, Luther held that women became witches by\nfree choice and that their driving motive to do so was fear for their families, their\npossessions, and their own well-being.\nYet another issue insufficiently considered in the intersection of witch-hunting and gender\nis that women were more likely than men to be accusers. In \u201cMalevolent Nurture: Witch-\nHunting and Maternal Power in Early Modern England\u201d(1995), Deborah Willis is critical of\nstudies that represent witch-hunts as \"all-male\" and \"univocally misogynist\"; she takes\nissue with the \"widely held feminist view that assigns the women accused of witchcraft to\nthe role of rebellious proto-feminists and the female accusers to that of patriarchal\nconformists\". The witch's \"malevolent, persecutory power,\" associated with the \"mother's\nbody, voice, or nurturant role,\" was \"a central feature of her ability to threaten order\".\nWhere Willis finds variations in the rewriting of witches across class lines in English\nsociety, Thompson's (1993) study adds local colour by concentrating on one area of rural\nEngland. Her most interesting finding is that women were twice as likely as men to be\naccusers. She places this within a larger trend of defamation suits, in which women\nresorted to words, including accusations of witch-craft, to attack neighbouring enemies.\nRobin Briggs (1996) points out that, actually the causes for witch-hunting were \"dauntingly\ncomplex,\" differing from place to place over time, and defying easy generalization. Briggs\nwrites, \"It is quite simply a fiction, in the sense that there is no evidence that witches\nexisted.\" For Briggs, the answer lies in the realities of early modern village life,\ncharacterized by all kinds of quarrels and tensions between neighbours who lived side by\nside for their entire lives in a minuscule \"universe of local feeling and feuding\".\nIn providing for an explanation of what structured the social action of individuals who\nmotivate witch hunt, Isaac Reed (2007) analyses witch hunts to be functional in a society\nwhere social actions are structured by necessity. Witch hunts are perhaps, as Kai Erickson\nsaid in his 1962 piece in Social Problems \u201cNotes on the Sociology of Deviance\u201d, a \u201cnormal\u201d\nresponse to \u201cabnormal\u201d social conditions. Thus, anthropologists & sociologists studying\nwitch hunts in pre modern Europe and Colonial America focus mainly on gender and\nrelated variables of economic disruptions, social & moral upheavals, religious rebellion as\nthe main motivations behind witch hunts. Witch hunts serve the purpose of maintaining\nsocial order in periods of conflicts, and witches are the perfect scapegoats to divert blame\nfor upheavals leading to disruptions.\n17 | Page\nAfrican Witch Hunts\nIn the past few decades of the twentieth century, most of the research on witch hunts was\ncarried out in the African nations by white western historians who were driven by a need\nto understand the newly independent modern states. Silvia Federici (2008)6 commented\nthat especially in Africa, witch hunt had become a serious problem over the past few\ndecades. As per her statistics in Kenya (2008), eleven people, eight women and three\nmen, were murdered, in the South-western province of Kisii, accused of witchcraft. She\nargues that these witch-hunts must be understood in the context of the deep crisis in the\nprocess of social reproduction that the liberalization and globalization of African\neconomies have produced, as they have undermined local economies, devalued women's\nsocial position, and generated intense conflicts between young and old, women and men,\nover the use of crucial economic resources starting with land. In this sense, she visualises\nthe present witch-hunts on a continuum with such phenomena as the dowry murders and\nthe return of sati in India, and the killings of hundreds of women in the Mexican towns at\nthe border with the U.S., victims of rapists or snuff/porno producers. Moreover, she points\nout that while mobilizing against these violations of women\u2019s rights, feminists should put\non trial the agencies that have created the material and social conditions that have made\nthem possible such as the African government, the World Bank, the International Monetary\nFund and their international supporters and more importantly the United Nations.\nAlthough the fear of witchcraft is often described as a deep-seated feature of Africa\u2019s\nbelief systems, assaults on 'witches' have intensified across Africa in the 1990s in ways\nunprecedented in the pre-colonial period. Figures are difficult to come by, since attacks\nand killings have often gone unpunished and unrecorded. But what is available shows the\nmagnitude of the problem. Many works of eminent scholars on witch-hunting in Africa such\nas Justus Ogembo's \"Contemporary Witch-hunting in Gusii, South-western Kenya\" (2006),\nAdam Ashford\u2019s (2005) \u201cWitchcraft, Violence, and Democracy in South Africa\u201d, Federici\nSilvia\u2019s (2004) \u201cCaliban and the witch: Women, the body and primitive accumulation\u201d,\netc. showed that the reasons of witch hunting in Africa were the same as in colonial\nEurope and America such as wealth accusation, economic globalization, social and\nreligious factors etc.\n2.2 Witch Hunting in India\nUnlike witch hunting studies in Europe, Africa and USA, the historians and sociologists have\nignored the study of witch hunts in India. Anthropologists have conducted a number of\nscholarly studies of witch hunts in other parts of the world, especially among the various\ntribes in Africa and South America. However, there are only a few studies on witch hunts\nin India namely F.G. Bailey\u2019s (1992) \u201cThe Witch Hunt or the Triumph of Morality\u201d; Mita\nBarman\u2019s (2002)\u201dPersecution of Women: Widows and Witches\u201d; Wolfgang Behringer\u2019s\n(2004)\u201dWitches and Witch Hunts.

The literatures related to\nwitch hunting in India identifies economic conditions, particularly the struggle for\nproperty between families, disease and illness, village level conflicts and gender conflicts\nas the leading causes of witch hunts (Barman, 2002; Chaudhuri, 1981; Kelkar and Nathan,\n1991; Mishra, 2003; Nathan et al., 1998). For instance, research on witch hunts in the\nJharkhand and Bihar states of India, focused on the agricultural land struggles between\nthe tribal widows and their kin as the leading cause of witch hunts.\nBarman (2002), one of the few anthropologists studying witch hunts in contemporary West\nBengal, claims that witch hunts are a form of \u201cpersecution\u201d towards women, especially\nwidows, who face a \u2018condition of marginality culminating in total exclusion from\nsociety\u2019. By accusing them of practicing witchcraft, those men inherit the land\nimmediately. This persecution is part of a wide assault on women\u2019s traditional rights and\npart of a successful attempt to establish a patriarchal order, an attempt to force women\ninto a particular gender role that is considered appropriate. It is also a way to discredit\nthe women who have an inside track with the household spirits. Kelkar et al. (1991) also\nstressed witch-hunts in tribal Bihar and West Bengal to the land rights of the widow. In\naddition to widows, women with separated/divorced husbands were vulnerable to\naccusations of witchcraft. The threat of such a label increases especially if she suddenly\nhas an increase in economic status especially from neighbours or kin. Moreover, the\nwomen suffering from any serious ailments such as cholera, small/chicken pox, diarrhoea,\netc. were also vulnerable to witch hunt. A major part of Mishra\u2019s (2003) study focuses on\nhealth and law in the tribal areas. According to her, due to lack of medical facilities in\ntribal areas, superstitions, illiteracy, etc. the people have a faith on the witch doctors\nwho are basically men. They are also viewed as religious ministers or religious priests, the\nones next to God, who play an active role in saving the people from epidemics with the\nhelp of special knowledge or skills that they posses. However, these male witch doctors\nalso play a crucial role in identifying a witch and instigating a witch hunt. Thus, witch\nhunts in contemporary India occur primarily among the tribal populations of Andhra\nPradesh, Bihar, Orissa, West Bengal and Jharkhand.\nA study conducted by Soma Chaturvedi, 2008, \u201cTempest in a Tea Pot; Analysis of\ncontemporary witch hunts in the tea plantation of Bengal\u201d reveals a link between witch\naccusations and neighbours and women being the main targets. She argues that in her\nstudy, there is no evidence on the relation between land ownership of the tribal widows\nand the witchcraft accusations. Instead, she says that \u201cwitch hunts are cultural; that is,\nwitch hunts cannot take place in a community where there is no real fear in witches\u201d.\nFurther, witch hunts arise from village level conflicts where women are the scapegoat. In\naddition, witch hunts are products of the prevalence of disease that provides the excuse\nor justification for the need for a witch hunt. Finally, the factors such as gender, poor\nhealth care, poor legal aid and belief in witches lead to witch hunts in the plantations.\nIn The Changing Status of Women in West Bengal, 1970-2000: The Challenge Ahead,\nAnuradha Chanda\u2019s (2005) essay on Tribal Women, revealed that the practice of witch\nhunting is also found among the Santhals of West Bengal. The women here are mostly\n19 | Page\nsubjected to oppression in case of witch hunting. The men have access over ritual\nknowledge which empower them to control women\u2019s labour and used consistently to\nimpose oppression on them. Moreover, as Mahasweta Devi (1990) writes, \u201cThe tribals\ntoday are pressed from all sides. They have lost their lands and are forced to work as\nmigrant labours. Their culture is threatened by the vulgar onslaught of jatra, films and\nvideo parlours. Political forces have created an exploitative elite class within them who\nexercise undue power. The dowry system has made its way into the tribal society. Faced\nwith such absolute erosion of traditional norms and culture, the tribals have held on to the\nwitch cult with a vengeance in order to assert their identity\u201d.7 Chanda further says the\nwitch hunting is now used for settling all kinds of scores such as land and political disputes\nand interpersonal differences.\nSimilarly, Gladson Dungdung8 in his work \u201cHunting Witches or Hunting Women? (2004)\nillustrated how two innocent women of a small village in Jharkhand, became victim of\nwitch hunting and how they were beaten to death. He agrees with Chanda(2005) and\nstates that the root cause is the patriarchal system. Men use weapons like witch-hunting\nto get rid of women they fear. In the Adivasi communities, it is largely women who are\nconsidered to have an evil influence and thus, capable of being witches. Witch hunting is\ncommon among the Santhal, Munda, Oraon and Kharia Adivasis. And, according to him,\n\u201cJharkhand is the worst affected state with witch hunting cases, holding police records of\n517 Adivasi women being killed in 10 districts in the past decade. Among them 124 women\nwere killed in Ranchi alone, 109 in West Singhbhum, 104 in Lohardaga, 89 in Gumla, 38 in\nPalamu, 17 in Garhwa, 15 in Hazaribagh, 10 in East Singhbhum, 8 in Kodarma and 3 in\nDhanbad. Andhra Pradesh ranks second in position with 147 cases of witch killing in 1999-\n2000. In Assam, 200 murder cases were filed for witch hunting. 5 cases of witch killing\nwere filed in Bihar in 2001. There were several cases of witch-hunting, which were never\nbrought to the attention of police because women are not aware about their rights and\nlack social security\u201d.9\nThe findings of the study \u201cContemporary Practices of Witch Hunting: A Report on Social\nTrends and the Interface with Law\u201d10 indicates that witch hunting primarily targets\nwomen. In 46 out of 48 case studies, the primary victims were women. An analysis of the\npolice records and the reported judgments also indicated 86 per cent primary targets of\nwitch hunting to be women. The victims cut across castes and communities, largely from\nweaker socio economic strata with the two seeming to belong to comparable social and\neconomic strata. The study also found, evidences of women being instigators of witch-\nhunting although men outnumber them in this respect. Allegations about use of\n\u2018supernatural\u2019 powers are invariably present in cases of witch hunting. But land, property,\njealousy, sexual advances and other common tensions between social intimates emerged\nas underlying factors in a very large number of cases. As per the statistics, as many as 71\nof the 86 FIRs involved physical violence and hurt, in addition to other offences, such as\ntheft, destruction of property, trespass and humiliation.

One Dalit woman belonging to\nKannepalli village of Luxettipet mandal, Adilabad district was killed by non-Dalits who\nsuspected her to be a witch. In some cases, if women had properties in their names, their\nown family members projected those women as witches and killed them. And in other\ninstances, many Dalit women were exploited and if some of them refused to yield, they\nwere branded as witches, paraded nude, and later killed. In one instance, one Dalit family\nhead was killed in the name of practicing witchcraft just because he refused to vote for a\nparticular party. Even the superstitions are used as oppressive methods against Dalits and\nDalit women. There are several interconnected social, political and economic causes for\nthe continued existence of these superstitions. One of the examples is of Ilamma (60) who\nbelonged to a Scheduled Caste (Mala). She stayed along with her husband, a daughter and\na son. The whole village of Warangal district in Telangana region believed her to be a\nwitch and held her responsible if the buffaloes stopped giving milk, or if children fell ill. In\nthe year 2000, villagers boycotted her family. In due course, her daughter-in-law, also\nstarted projecting Ilamma as a witch, probably because she felt the old woman was a\nheavy burden to feed, and held her responsible for her father's death. Ilamma left the\nvillage and went to her sister's place in Bethikal village in Karimnagar district. After three\nyears, one night in 2003, the village suspected that Ilamma had placed lemons before a\nfew houses. The villagers, reportedly, searched Ilamma's house and found some lemons\nand turmeric powder in a bag. The furious villagers made her eat human excreta; they\naccused Ilamma of wandering around the village, at midnight, on amavasya and pournami\ndays.13\nA similar incidence occurred in August 2004, a middle-aged woman, Dituben Shinghod in\nVadodara, Gujarat - branded as a witch - was hacked to death by villagers in Dahod. The\npolice did not find any motive except that the victim was suspected to be a witch. Two\nbrothers, Raman Malcwana and Savshingh Makwana of Zari Bujarg village in Garbada\nTaluka, accused her of casting a spell on their niece who had been sick. When the girl\ndied, they ran into Dituben's house shouting that she had killed the girl. Dituben tried to\nrun but was hit with a scythe and an axe, killing her on the spot. Savshingh was arrested\nbut Raman absconded.14 In the same year in September 2004, a man beheaded his sister-\nin-law in a village in Jharkhand, because he claimed she was a witch. Gansu Singh\nbeheaded his sister-in-law with a sharp-edged weapon, and then got her head tonsured\nand went to police station. He had no regrets over the murder because he held her\nresponsible for the death of his three children. The children had died due to a diseases\nand he suspected that the victim had used black magic to kill them.15\n11 Source: http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/inclusion-of-witchhunting-under-laws-on-domestic-violence-and-\nsexual-harassment-favoured/article5408947.ece\n12 Karthik Navayan is a human rights activists.\n13 Source: http://roundtableindia.co.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4332:killings-in-the-name-\nof-witchcraft-&catid=119:feature&Itemid=132\n14 Source: The Times of India, 2004\n15 Source: The Hindustan Times, 2004\n21 | Page\nThe practice of witch hunting is not only prominent among the tribal or indigenous\ncommunities of Gujarat, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal, but\nit is also found in the north-eastern region. In the north-eastern region of India, which is\nhome to diverse indigenous communities, the practice is more prominent in Assam. It may\nnot be simply coincidental that Assam also has the lowest gender development index\namong the north-eastern states. There have been at least 65 cases of witch hunting\nreported during 2007-2012 from Assam alone. The practice is more prominent among the\nRabha, Hajong, Mishing, Bodo and other Adivasi communities in Assam.16 Joya Chakraborty\n& Anjuman Borah (2013) 17 in their paper titled \u201cWitch hunting in Assam: Strategising\nAlternative Media for Women Empowerment and Overcoming Superstition\u201d analyses the\nprevalence of witch hunting in Assam and through case study of the initiatives undertaken\nby Assam Mahila Samata Society (AMSS) towards rescue and rehabilitation of the victims,\nattempts to understand the role of alternative communication strategies in mitigation of\nthe problem. Chakraborty (2013) states that in Assam, the witch is called a \u2018daini\u2019 in local\nparlance and believed to cause ailment to people, destroy crops and other livestock, etc.\nShe is usually identified by an \u2018ojha\u2019, \u2018bez\u2019 or \u2018deodhani\u2019 (all names for witch doctors) and\neither banished from the community or killed. Sometimes, the designated family of the\nwitch is levied a hefty fine by the community leaders, by which she may be pardoned of\nher ill deeds/intentions against the fellow villagers. The process of identification of the\nwitch is specified by the witch doctor by looking into the symptoms of the patient such as,\nfever, cough-cold, delirium or hysteria. As soon as it is believed that a disease has been\ncaused due to the \u2018witch craft\u2019 people try to get rid of the spell through prayers and\nofferings. They offer boiled rice together with a cock reduced to ashes in a banana leaf\nand keep it in the middle of a road for the \u2018daini\u2019. People believe that without these\nprayers and offerings, the patient would not survive. It is also believed that there are\nsome diseases which cannot be treated by the medical doctor and needs to be addressed\nspecifically by an ojha. The patient, if suspected by the ojha to be under the spell of a\nwitch, is covered by a hunting net and poked with a sharp object till he/she names the\nwitch. In other cases the ojha performs some religious rites to arrive at the description of\nthe person practicing the witch craft. Identified by this process, the alleged Witch is then\neither lynched to death or forced to run away abandoning her family and property.\nGoalpara is one of the worst affected districts in the State of Assam in terms of prevalence\nof witch hunting practices. Around 51 cases of witch hunting have been reported in this\ndistrict alone since the year 1998. In one instance, on 17 May, 2001, when a woman in the\nBorjhora Dhaporbila village fell ill, Jonal Rabha, a mother of two children was accused of\ncasting evil spells on the woman. She was branded a witch and a mob of villagers attacked\nher. She somehow ran for her life and took shelter in a nearby village. However, although\nthe people have accepted her after a settlement and a police compliant, she still faces\ndiscrimination. In another instance, a woman in the village had fallen sick and the Oja was\ncalled in to treat her. As per the customary practice, the Oja kept on pricking her with the\npointed teeth of a swine till in a state of delirium she uttered the name of Jogai Bala. The\nvillagers lost no time in launching a brutal attack on her. Her son managed to save her but\n16 Chakraborty, et. al. 2013\n17 Joya Chakraborty and Anjuman Borah are Assistant Professors at the Department of Mass Communication and\nJournalism, Tezpur University, Tezpur, Assam, India\n22 | Page\n65 years old Jogai Bala was compelled to leave the village. Her son then took her away to\nTura in West Garo Hills, Meghalaya and kept her with him for nine years. Nine years later,\nthe matter was taken up by the AMSS and she was brought back to the village.18\nIn another instance of Subhadra Bassumatarey, a 45-year-old woman, was declared a witch\nby the local witch doctor (ojha) in August 2000 and did not return to her village in the\nGoalpara district in Assam. Subhadra, a member of the All India Democratic Women's\nAssociation (AIDWA), had challenged the obscurantist practices of Ojhas for which she had\nincurred their wrath. Further, she had demanded a share in her late father's property,\nchallenging her step-brother's claim to the whole property. The stepbrother and the local\nojha in the area developed a common interest in eliminating her, so she was declared a\nwitch and accused of casting a spell on three children in the village who had fallen sick.\nOne night, a group of men, accompanied by a female ojha, abducted Subhadra, took her\nto a lonely spot and asked her to sign a confession that she was a witch. She refused to\nsign; they then proceeded to break her right arm saying that this was the punishment for\nnot signing. When she still refused, they assaulted her and broke her ribs and she was left\nfor dead. Her husband later found her and rushed her to the district hospital. Later,\nwomen organizations provided shelter to the victim (Karat, 2001).\nHowever, in Tripura, also there are evidences of witch hunting. One, Laxmi Dev Burman, a\ncommunist member and also an active worker of the AIDWA, had taken her colleague to\nthe local hospital for treatment of fever, but she died. The following night, a group of\nmen known to be involved with the NLFT, a terrorist group in Tripura, came to Laxmi's\nhouse and they dragged her out, hacked her to death and put up notices in the village that\nshe had to be killed because she was a 'witch' (Rajalakshmi, 2000).\nAccording to Nath (2005)19, it appears that the ultimate reason of witch hunting among the\nBodo communities of Assam is economic, ownership of property, especially land and\nprofessional jealousy of men against women who handle all power to treat diseases in a\nsociety that is far superstitious and devoid of all knowledge of modern science and\ntechnology.\nThus, the cases highlight the scale and severity of witch-hunting incidents in India. The\nmurders of individual women and entire families accused of witchcraft appears to be\ncommon in states such as Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Assam, Tripura,\nMadhya Pradesh and Maharastra. According to Shrestha (2004), in India, the main victims\nof witchcraft allegations have been mostly tribal women and women belonging to the\nvarious Dalit communities. However, the immediate causes behind witch hunting are\nvarious such as sickness and fatalities, beliefs, illiteracy and lack of awareness, loss of\nproperty, personal disputes, etc. She further states that women in India have unequal\naccess to productive resources, food and health care, education and employment and also\nunequal access to the judicial system which makes them vulnerable. Although possessing\nmaintenance rights, in the event their spouses die; the greed by their kith and kin to\nillegally acquire the land leads to accusations of women on witchcraft, resulting in torture\nand even death. In India, witch-hunting is related to attempts by male members within\n18 Chakraborty, et. al. 2013\n19 http://dspace.nehu.ac.in/handle/1/9360\n23 | Page\ntribal communities' to deprive the women of their lights to inheritance land. Cultural\nviolence legitimizes the direct and structural violence.\n2.3 Summary\nWitch-hunting incidents in various countries indicate a rising trend. The above instances\nhave depicted how violence against women in the form of witch hunting - continues\nunabated in India and other countries. Given the situation, what has been the response\nand strategies from the concerned persons to stop or check this form of violence against\nwomen? Nevertheless, various strategies have been adopted by the government and civil\nsociety vis-\u00e0-vis domestic laws and international human rights instruments. But, the\nresponse from the governments has been slow and only recently is note being taken. For\ninstance, it was only in 1999 that the Indian state of Bihar passed the bill making witch-\nhunting unlawful, with jurisdiction in that particular state only. Lately, the government of\nIndia is considering proposal to implement new laws to make witch-hunting a social crime.\nThe passing of these laws will send a strong signal that the practice of witchcraft\nallegations will be considered a grave crime.\n\"Laws are a major tool in promoting and protecting human rights and they play a vital role\nin the well being of any society\" (Goonesekere, 2004). Although laws alone cannot address\nthe problem, legal norms and standard setting are essential dimensions to prevent or\neliminate violence against women and protest and realize women's human rights to\npersonal security, personal liberty and range of socio-economic rights (Goonesekere,\n2004). Without effective legal measures, many perpetrators enjoy impunity and victims do\nnot get justice. Enactment of strict laws would be necessary to prevent women being\ntortured and accused of witchcraft. The culture of violence against women from all levels\nviz. structure, culture and individual would be tackled and supplemented by efforts to\nusher socioeconomic change (including value systems) in these societies.\n24 | Page\nCHAPTER - III\nSOCIO-ECONOMIC & DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE\nThe socio-economic, cultural and religious setting of an area and people largely\ndetermines their belief system. So, before elucidating about the nature and extent of\nwitch hunting in the studied area, it is imperative to have a detailed understanding about\nthe socio-economic and cultural background of the people.\n3.1 Population and Distribution\nThe study covered a total of 606 respondents (as shown in below table 3.1). Notably, the\nproportion of male respondents (74 per cent) is higher than the female respondents (26\nper cent). In the state of Bihar, a total of 199 respondents were interviewed, out of\nwhich, 63 per cent were males and 37 per cent females. Similarly, 209 respondents were\ninterviewed in the state of Jharkhand, out of which 70 per cent were males and 30 per\ncent females. In Odisha, 198 respondents were intervened, out of which surprisingly, 90\nper cent were males and a very minimal of 10 per cent were females.\nTable 3.1: Gender Distribution of the Respondents\nState/District Male Respondents Female respondents Total\nJahanabad 11.5 88.5 52\nNalanda 80.9 19.1 47\nNawada 66.0 34.0 50\nRohtas 98.0 2.0 50\nBihar 63.3 36.7 199\nDeoghar 52.0 48.0 50\nDumka 96.4 3.6 56\nGiridih 74.5 25.5 55\nHazaribagh 52.1 47.9 48\nJharkhand 69.9 30.1 209\nBhadrak 76.0 24.0 50\nGajapati 94.0 6.0 50\nKoraput 98.0 2.0 50\nSonepur 93.8 6.3 48\nOdisha 90.4 9.6 198\nTotal 74.4 25.6 606\nSource: Field Study\nAs regards to the age-groups of the respondents, it was found that majority of the\nrespondents (57 per cent) were in the age-group of 15-60 years (as shown in below table\n3.2).

However, a small proportion of respondents also belonged\nto the religion of Christianity (14 per cent). Across the sample states, the proportion of\nHindus is highest in the state of Bihar, followed by Jharkhand and Odisha as shown in the\ntable 3.3 below.

The state of Bihar has the highest\nconcentration of Scheduled caste communities (61 per cent), followed by Odisha (52 per\ncent) and Jharkhand (40 per cent). However, among the intervened households, the\nproportion of Scheduled tribes was found to be high in Odisha (41 per cent) and low in\nBihar (12 per cent).\nTable 3.4: Percentage Distribution of Household by Social Category\nState/District SC ST OBC general Others Total Total\nhousehold\nsurveyed\nJahanabad 71.2 11.5 17.3 0.0 0.0 100.0 52\nNalanda 93.6 2.1 4.3 0.0 0.0 100.0 47\nNawada 66.0 32.0 2.0 0.0 0.0 100.0 50\nRohtas 14.0 0.0 86.0 0.0 0.0 100.0 50\nBihar 60.8 11.6 27.6 0.0 0.0 100.0 199\nDeoghar 54.0 14.0 28.0 4.0 0.0 100.0 50\nDumka 1.8 53.6 42.9 1.8 0.0 100.0 56\nGiridih 81.8 3.6 9.1 1.8 3.6 100.0 55\nHazaribagh 20.8 56.3 18.8 4.2 0.0 100.0 48\nJharkhand 39.7 31.6 24.9 2.9 1.0 100.0 209\nBhadrak 68.0 32.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 100.0 50\nGajapati 8.0 92.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 100.0 50\nKoraput 36.0 38.0 0.0 26.0 0.0 100.0 50\nSonepur 97.9 2.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 100.0 48\nOdisha 52.0 41.4 0.0 6.6 0.0 100.0 198\nTotal 50.7 28.2 17.7 3.1 0.3 100.0 606\nSource: Field Study\n3.4 Educational Status\nThe educational status of the respondents revealed that the rate of female illiteracy (55\nper cent) is more than male illiteracy (23 per cent) and it is highest in Bihar (70 per cent)\nand Odisha (60 per cent). This can be attributed to the existence of the supernatural\nbelief and practices of witch hunting and subsequent cohesion in the states. Among the\nliterates, majority of the male respondents studied till primary and middle level education\nwhereas the female respondents attended below primary level education. This accounts\nfor their low educational status, which in turn affects their overall socio-economic and\npolitical sphere.\nTable 3.5: Educational Status of the Respondents\nSex Status Bihar Jharkhand Odisha Total\nMale Illiterate 49.2 12.4 7.1 22.8\nInformal education 12.6 4.8 7.6 8.3\nbelow primary 4.5 10.5 14.6 9.9\nPrimary 10.6 15.3 33.3 19.6\n27 | Page\nMiddle 7.5 12.9 25.3 15.2\nSecondary 8.0 16.3 3.5 9.4\nHigher Secondary 5.0 18.7 4.5 9.6\nGraduation/BA/Degree and above 2.5 8.6 3.5 5.0\nTechnical 0.0 0.0 0.5 0.2\nOther 0.0 0.5 0.0 0.2\nTotal 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0\nFemale Illiterate 70.2 35.9 60.1 55.0\nInformal education 9.1 6.2 10.6 8.6\nbelow primary 4.5 10.5 17.6 10.8\nPrimary 5.1 10.5 1.1 5.7\nMiddle 3.5 9.6 3.2 5.5\nSecondary 3.0 13.4 2.7 6.6\nHigher Secondary 3.5 9.6 4.3 5.9\nGraduation/BA/Degree and above 1.0 3.8 0.5 1.8\nOther 0.0 0.5 0.0 0.2\nTotal 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0\nSource: Field Study\n3.5 Occupation\nThe present study revealed that the major occupation of the respondents is cultivation (21\nper cent) and casual labourer in agricultural (32 per cent) and non-agricultural sectors (33\nper cent). Table 3.6 reveals that in Bihar, majority of them are engaged as casual labourer\nin agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. Similarly, in Jharkhand, the people are\nengaged as cultivators and casual labourers in non-agricultural sector. However, in Odisha,\nthe people primarily engage themselves in cultivation. A negligible proportion of\nrespondents are also engaged in various other activities such as bonded labour, unpaid\nfamily labour, salaried in Government and private sector, personal services, skilled\nartisan, etc. Thus, from this, it can be inferred that the people have subsistence economy\nand lack of employment opportunities. It was also found that 71 per cent of the\nhouseholds belonged to below poverty line (BPL) category. It is highest in Bihar (80 per\ncent) and Odisha (75 per cent).\nTable 3.6: Occupational Status of the Respondents\nWork Status Bihar Jharkhand Odisha Total\nCultivator 6.0 14.4 41.4 20.5\nCasual labour in agriculture 54.8 12.4 29.3 31.8\nCasual labour in non-agriculture 30.7 41.1 26.3 32.8\nAttached/bonded labour 3.5 4.8 0.5 3.0\nUnpaid family labour 0.0 1.9 1.0 1.0\nRegular salaried wage in government sector 0.0 5.7 0.5 2.1\nRegular salaried wage in private sector 1.5 3.3 0.0 1.7\nOwn account worker (self-employed) 0.5 7.2 0.0 2.6\nPersonal Services (Jajmani) 1.5 0.0 0.0 0.5\nSkilled Artisans 0.5 5.7 0.0 2.1\nTrader 0.0 1.9 0.0 0.7\n28 | Page\nDomestic work 0.5 0.0 0.0 0.2\nRetired/pensioner/ too old 0.0 1.0 1.0 0.7\nBeggar 0.0 0.5 0.0 0.2\nOther 0.5 0.0 0.0 0.2\nTotal 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0\nTotal household surveyed 199 209 198 606\nSource: Field Study\n3.6 Income Level\nThe empirical data shows that majority of the households (27 per cent) belonged to the\nincome group of Rs. 20001-30000 per annum.

However, they also\ndepend on public stand post (26 per cent) as well as open wells (14 per cent) for fetching\ndrinking water. Table 3.8 depicts that in Bihar, the people mostly depend on public hand\nposts and local hand pumps for their source of drinking water. In Jharkhand, there are\nmultiple sources of water such as, public stand post (31 per cent), open well (27 per cent),\nlocal hand pump (21 per cent) and household tap supply (18 per cent). Interestingly,\nmajority of the people in Odisha, procure water from local hand pumps (50 per cent) and\nthe most unsafe and unhygienic source of water i.e. rivers/streams/ nalas (23 per cent).\nTable 3.8: Distribution of Household by Source of Water\nDistrict/State\n30 | Page\npaT\ndlohesuoH\nylppus\nretaw\ntsoP\ndnatS\ncibuP\npmuP\ndnaH\nlacol\n3/2\nkraM\naidnI\nalaN/maertS\n/reviR\nretawniaR detsevrah\ndnoP\nllew\nnepO rehto\nTotal\nJahanabad 3.8 17.3 73.1 1.9 1.9 1.9 0.0 0.0 0.0 100.0\nNalanda 4.3 48.9 44.7 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 2.1 0.0 100.0\nNawada 6.0 22.0 72.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 100.0\nRohtas 0.0 48.0 52.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 100.0\nBihar 3.5 33.7 60.8 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.0 0.5 0.0 100.0\nDeoghar 10.0 22.0 36.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 32.0 0.0 100.0\nDumka 32.1 62.5 3.6 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.8 0.0 0.0 100.0\nGiridih 23.6 29.1 20.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.8 23.6 1.8 100.0\nHazaribagh 2.1 6.3 27.1 0.0 6.3 0.0 0.0 58.3 0.0 100.0\nJharkhand 17.7 31.1 21.1 0.0 1.4 0.0 1.0 27.3 0.5 100.0\nBhadrak 2.0 8.0 90.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 100.0\nGajapati 0.0 10.0 36.0 0.0 30.0 0.0 0.0 24.0 0.0 100.0\nKoraput 0.0 4.0 16.0 0.0 60.0 0.0 0.0 20.0 0.0 100.0\nSonepur 0.0 35.4 56.3 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 8.3 0.0 100.0\nOdisha 0.5 14.1 49.5 0.0 22.7 0.0 0.0 13.1 0.0 100.0\nTotal 7.4 26.4 43.4 0.2 8.1 0.2 0.3 13.9 0.2 100.0\nSource: Field Study\nThe sanitation facility in the studied villages is a matter of concern.

The woman who is perceived to be practicing witchcraft is punished\nseverely by the whole community and branded as \u2018dayan\u2019, \u2018chudail\u2019, etc. It is one such\ndangerous superstition that often kills the victim. The belief in the practice of witchcraft\nis part of almost all living societies and some traces of it can be felt at various degrees\namong all communities, especially Dalits and Adivasis. The practice is dominant among the\nsocially excluded communities of states like Jharkhand, West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha,\nGujarat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, even today. It has been considered as a mere\nsuperstitious act for a long time; however, the studies and observations by sociologists and\nanthropologists reveal a completely different story. Dalit woman who are rebellious in\nnature or a threat to the patriarchal system or widows who possess some property are the\nones who are tormented on the name of being a witch. It is a conspiracy to throw them\nout of the community; to acquire their property or suppress their voice. Witch hunting is\nalso understood as a manifestation of the low social status of women whereby male\nattitude of dominance and violence against women is legitimized by calling her a witch\n(Chaudhuri, 2012).\nWitch hunting is a prearranged act of violence against Dalit and Adivasi women whereby\nthe entire community sanctions the punishment meted out to the person being accused of\n\u201cwitch\u201d. As a social evil, it is more difficult to tackle because the motivation of such\naction is often rooted in the traditional spiritual and cultural belief system of the\ncommunities which is misinterpreted by few persons for manipulating the situation. Thus,\nwitch hunting perpetuates through a conspiracy of ignorance, fear and vested interest.\n4.2 Findings of the study\nBelief in witches and witch practices occupies a central place in rural socially excluded\nDalits\u2019 spiritual and ethical life. They firmly believe in controlling the evil spirit by seeking\nhelp of good spirits through magic and exorcism. They also draw boundaries between\nwhite magic (benevolent) and black magic (malevolent). The ojha (local doctor), the\ndiviner or the medicine man, practices the white magic. He uses his powers to counteract\nthe powers of the dayan or the witch. It is a common belief among the Dalits and Adivasis\nthat a witch possesses supernatural powers which can harm animals, children, men, and\nwomen and even make them fatally ill. The witch can cause illness such as diarrhoea,\nmalaria, tuberculosis, common fever, stomach ailments, etc. Sometimes she may cause\ninfertility also. In this connection, it is imperative to explore and examine the claim of\nexistence of witches and the perception of the people to get a better understanding of the\nissue, before continuing on to the nature and extent of violence meted against these\nalleged witches and the mechanisms to control it.\n4.2.1 Perception of Witchcraft\nThe first question that one has to deal with is whether people have heard of witches? Are\nthere really such women? And, if yes, do they believe in witches?

Various studies reveal that the practice of witchcraft and \u2018witch-hunting' in\nparts of India appears to be prevalent predominantly among certain castes and tribes\nthough the present study shows that allegation on women for being a witch is found among\nmuslim hamlets as well in Jharkhand . The following Figure 4.4 shows a detailed picture\nregarding the perception of people on the castes of accused witches. Around 32 per cent\nof the respondents revealed that the alleged witches belong to the lower Dalit caste\ncommunity. These communities have lived a socially, economically, educationally\nexcluded and deprived life for centuries. They have suffered the burden of heinous forms\nof discrimination and exploitation in the society, including witch practices. There are also\nwomen from other castes who are branded as witch. However, their proportion in relation\nto Dalit women is minimal. It is a Dalit woman who suffers the most of Witch accusation\nand persecution. Various focused group discussions and in-depth interviews with the\nauthorities, doctors, media personnel, political and local representatives, Panchayat level\nrepresentatives, etc. also proved the fact that the existence and persecution of witch\nhunting is highly prevalent among the Dalit communities.\n38 | Page\nFigure 4.4: Respondents\u2019 Revelation on the Caste of Witches\nSource: Field Study\n4.2.5 Reason and Sources of Treatment\nApart from the belief and perception of the people regarding witch and witch practices, it\nis also important to understand the dynamics of the source and reason of treatment of\nailments believed to be caused by the witch.

The people of the studied villages\nbelieve that without these prayers and offerings, the patient would not survive. It is only\nafter failure from Ojhas that they seek medical treatment. It was also reported that\nsometimes, patients die due to delay in treatment. If the patient dies the belief of\nexistence of a witch gets further vindicated and the identification and persecution of the\nwitch starts. In the present study, out of a total of 581 households who are going for\ntreatment, more than 60 per cent go to private doctors and Government hospitals for\ntreatment and 45 per cent exclusively go to Ojhas for treatment (as shown in below Table\n4.4). The proportion of people going to Ojhas for treatment is similar across the studied\nstates. However, majority of Dalits from Jharkhand (66 per cent) and Odisha (62 per cent)\ngo to Government hospital for treatment as compared to Bihar (40 per cent). The\nproportion of people consulting private doctor is highest in Bihar (74 per cent), followed\nby Jharkhand (62 per cent) and Odisha (48 per cent).\nA deep analyisi about the qualification private doctors to whom the affected people are\nvisiting for medical help reveals that most of them are not qualified doctors. They are\nregister medical practioners, pharmacists, nurses etc. When the victims go government\nhospital to access medical services, they are subjected to discrimination. During the\ninterview with the victims and victims\u2019 family reveals that the doctors do not touch them\nand prescribe treatment without examining their health. In addition to this, absence of\n40 | Page\nmedical workers is very common in the hospital as they do not prefer to work in rural\nareas work in the private clinic during working hours. Doctors posted at remote facilities\nand at facilities with poor infrastructure and equipment are absent at significantly higher\nrates, as are those with longer commutes.\nDue to lack of awareness and medical care, many of them suffer from reproductive health\ncomplications; including STDs and cervical cancer.They do not get basic medical facilities.\nPregnant Dalit women receive discriminatory treatment in hospitals and there are\ninstances where doctors have refused to conduct the delivery of Dalit women.\nSanghmitra S Acharya (2010)20 provides evidence on discriminatory access to Scheduled\nCastes women and children to primary health services which in turn lead to lower\nutilisation of health services. The study reported that health personnel discriminate\nScheduled Castes by not visiting their habitations and families. When they do visit, they\nexpress discomfort and disrespect for the clients. Further, most healthcare camps are held\nin the dominant caste habitations and hence the use by Dalit communities is restricted.21\nThe following table depicts the spheres and indicators of discrimination faced by Dalit\nwomen in public health services:\nSpheres of Discrimination Identifiers of Discrimination Consequences of Discrimination\nTreatment at the time of Face rude verbal responses from Lack of care leads to\nantenatal check-up health workers.

Across the states, it\nvaries from 22 per cent in Odisha to 54 per cent in Jharkhand. Moreover, it was also\nreported by 30 per cent of the respondents that the reason for consulting the Ojhas is due\nto failure of doctor\u2019s treatment.

They firmly believe that\na witch casts evil spells and black magic through some acquired supernatural powers and\ndo harm to the community and livestock. And, to get rid of the harmful effects of a witch,\nthey consult the local Ojhas or gunias, who offers prayers and charms. The villager\u2019s\nconviction in the Ojhas is so strong that they are blindfolded of the malicious intentions of\nthe Ojhas. Thus, this gives rise to conflicts and violence in the community. And, the\nalleged victim is severely ostracised and even lynched to death. The scale and severity of\nthe violence against Dalit women in regard to witch hunting has been explicitly discussed\nin the subsequent chapter.\n43 | Page\nCHAPTER - V\nINCIDENCE AND VIOLENCE OF WITCH HUNTING\n5.1 Introduction\nThe Dalit women face the burden of multiple disadvantages and vulnerabilities in everyday\nlife. The human rights and dignity of Dalit women are generally violated by heinous forms\nof atrocities and mayhem, often leading to death of the person. Special Rapporteur on\nviolence against women, Ms. Yakin Ert\u00fcrk (2009) quoted - \u201cDalit women are confronted\nwith discrimination, exclusion and violence to a larger extent than men. Land and\nproperty issues in particular, tend to cause or be at the root of conflicts over which Dalit\nwomen have faced eviction, harassment, physical abuse and assault. Dalit women are\noften denied access to or are evicted from their land by dominant castes, especially if it\nborders land belonging to such castes. They are thus forced to live in the outskirts of\nvillages, often on barren land. Reportedly, on many occasions, cases of violence against\nDalit women are not registered, and adequate procedures are not taken by the police.\u201d22\nThe European Parliament adopted a resolution on violence against women in India which\nincludes several references to caste discrimination and the situation of Dalit women in\nJanuary 2013. The resolution expresses \u201cdeep concern about the widespread violence\ncommitted against Dalit women and girls in India, including sexual violence committed by\nmen of dominant castes.\u201d23 The Dalit women face various forms of violence like verbal\nabuse, physical assault, sexual harassment and assault, domestic violence, rape, murder,\ndowry related violence and not the least witch hunting.\nWitch hunting is a superstitious practice which entails the worst forms of cultural violence\nagainst women in a society. The suspected women are brutally tortured and inhumanly\ntreated. Although, there has been widespread scientific and technological development in\nthe country, but still in many parts, the women, especially Dalits and Adivasis suffer\nmercilessly due to the gruesome practice. The National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB)\nreported that in 2011, 242 cases of witchcraft-related murders were reported from\ndifferent states of India. In Karnataka 77 witch-related murders were reported, followed\nby Odisha with 41 cases, Jharkhand with 36 cases, Andhra Pradesh with 29 cases of\nmurder, Chhattisgarh, where 17 witch-related murders were reported, Madhya Pradesh\nwith 15, Maharashtra with 13, Assam and Haryana with 5 each, Meghalaya with 3 deaths\nand Rajasthan with 1 death in 2011. Although, the witch-related murders have decreased\nin 2012 to 121 cases, but, still it is significantly evidenced in Odisha with 32 cases,\nfollowed by Jharkhand with 22 cases, Andhra Pradesh with 24 cases, Bihar with 13 cases,\nMadhya Pradesh with 11 cases of murder, etc.24 According to a study conducted by Rural\nLitigation and Entitlement Kendra (RLEK), Dehradun, more than 2,500 women have been\nkilled in India in the past 15 years after being accused of practicing witchcraft. On an\naverage, as many as 200 women get lynched under witch-craft related crimes.25 In this\nregard, the present chapter discusses the scale and severity of the violence meted against\nthe Dalit women of the studied area. The chapter also discussed the incidences, processes\n22 Addendum to Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women, Ms. Yakin Ert\u00fcrk\u201fs report to 11th HRC session, June\n2009 (A/HRC/11/6/Add.1)\n23 European Parliament resolution of 13 December 2012 on caste discrimination in India (2012/2909(RSP)\n24 Crimes in India: 2011, National Crime Records Bureau, Government of India\n25 The Hindu, July 26, 2010\n44 | Page\naanndd aaccttiivviittiieess ooff wwiittcchh aattttaacckk..

This bought a change in the mindset of the villagers and they accused\nSakina biwi for his death. The boy\u2019s family members and the villagers regard her as a\nwitch who casts evil spells and black magic. She and her family were subjected to abusive\nlanguage, harsh treatment and even beaten badly. Moreover, Sakina biwi was forced to\nconsume human excreta and urine. Importantly, they faced the humiliation and\ndiscrimination by their own Muslim community. Thus, there exists a class-based\ndiscrimination with the caste group. Even the socially excluded Dalits and Adivasis residing\nin the village did not come to their rescue. Moreover, her husband\u2019s and sons\u2019 plea and\ncomplain to the police was in vain. Although, the matter was resolved internally by the\nvillagers, but today also she is looked upon as a witch.\nSource: Filed Survey by NACDOR Team, of Lakhanpur village of Dumka district, Jharkhand\nTable 5.1: Type of Violence against Witches\nType of violence Bihar Jharkhand Odisha Total\nBeat up 56.3 54.7 24.1 45.1\nForced to consume human excreta/urine 20.7 40.7 56.0 39.4\nParaded naked 4.4 2.0 39.7 15.3\nPhysically abused, ostracized and driven from their 30.4 38.7 40.4 36.6\nhomes\nMob lynching, gang rape 0.7 2.0 39.0 13.8\nBlackening of face 2.2 5.3 10.6 6.1\nShaving of head 0.7 1.3 4.3 2.1\nLocked her in a dark room 0.0 0.7 10.6 3.8\nPull my nails out 0.7 0.0 9.2 3.3\nStrings of shoes hung around their necks 0.7 1.3 9.2 3.8\nSocial stigma, displacement, economic boycott 19.3 16.7 19.1 18.3\nPhysically injured (Noses cut or pull out teeth) 6.7 10.0 7.1 8.0\nOthers 3.7 16.0 4.3 8.2\nNumber of household opined 135 150 141 426\nSource: Field Study\n5.2.2 Incidences of Witch Violence\nThe study made an attempt to understand the ground realities of witch hunting.

To the question on occurrence of any witch practices cases in\ntheir own family or relatives, above 90 per cent affirmed of coming across incidences of\nwitchcraft in their own family or neighbours. While 87 per cent households experienced\nwitchcraft cases in their own family or neighbours in Bihar, around 93 per cent in\nJharkhand and 95 per cent in Odisha experienced such incidences in their own\nfamily/neighbours (Figure 5.2).

The\nwomen are accused of witches and persecuted in various severe forms. The empirical data\nrevealed that after confirmation from the Ojhas, the accused Witch is immediately\nexpelled from the family and neighbours (52 per cent) along with verbally abusing and\ntorturing (47 per cent). According to below table 5.4, around 30 per cent reported of\ncomplaining the ward member or Samaj against the witch and 19 per cent stated they the\nwitch family is socially discarded. Above 30 per cent stated that the alleged Witch is\nphysically beaten and forced to go to the ojha. Importantly, the action of registering\ncomplain in the police station is very low across all states. It is inferred from the data that\nthe persecution against the identified witches is vastly rampant in the state of Odisha.\n(Include a case study of Odisha on violence).\n50 | Page\nTable 5.4: Type of Action Taken After Identifying the Witch\nDistrict/State\n51 | Page\nhtiw\nnoitaler\nffo\ntuC\nylimaf\nreh\ndna\nhctiw\neht\nesuba\nyllabreV\nylimaf\nreh\ndna\nhctiw\ndraw\not\nnialpmoC\neht\ntsniaga\nrebmem\nhctiw\neht\ntaeb\nyllacisyhP\nylimaf\nhctiw\nro\nhctiw\ndedracsid\nyllaicoS\nylimaf\nhctiw\not\nhctiw\neht\ndecroF\nyb\nenod\najup\not\nemoc\nahjo\nnoitats\necilop\nni\nRIF\nsrehtO latoT\nJahanabad 62.2 32.4 8.1 0.0 5.4 2.7 8.1 5.4 100.0\nNalanda 32.3 61.3 6.5 0.0 0.0 9.7 3.2 0.0 100.0\nNawada 41.9 48.8 7.0 4.7 16.3 14.0 9.3 4.7 100.0\nRohtas 53.8 26.9 11.5 0.0 7.7 0.0 0.0 0.0 100.0\nBihar 47.4 43.1 8.0 1.5 8.0 7.3 5.8 2.9 100.0\nDeoghar 64.5 45.2 6.5 0.0 9.7 3.2 0.0 0.0 100.0\nDumka 80.0 16.0 12.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 4.0 0.0 100.0\nGiridih 41.8 23.6 12.7 1.8 5.5 10.9 7.3 3.6 100.0\nHazaribagh 39.1 52.2 17.4 15.2 8.7 23.9 6.5 2.2 100.0\nJharkhand 51.6 35.0 12.7 5.1 6.4 11.5 5.1 1.9 100.0\nBhadrak 92.6 3.7 0.0 0.0 96.3 92.6 0.0 0.0 100.0\nGajapati 50.0 77.1 87.5 50.0 20.8 10.4 2.1 0.0 100.0\nKoraput 49.0 69.4 55.1 53.1 32.7 22.4 4.1 12.2 100.0\nSonepur 47.8 67.4 73.9 43.5 37.0 21.7 2.2 2.2 100.0\nOdisha 55.9 60.6 60.6 41.2 40.6 30.0 2.4 4.1 100.0\nTotal 51.9 46.8 28.9 17.2 19.4 17.0 4.3 3.0 100.0\nSource: Field Study\n5.2.6: Impact on socio economic and psychological wellbeing of women accused of\nbeing a witch\nOnce the accusation is levelled, most immediate impacts are psychological. These have\nbeen demonstrated through resistance and avoidance behaviour following the response\npattern on fight and flight. Several cases demonstrate the severe debilitating impact on\nthe psychological health of women being accused of a witch. This was evident in the case\nof a 55 year old widow named Savitri Devi of Darnai village in Makdumpur block of\nJehanabad district in Bihar. A woman of 55 years looked 20 years elder than her age. She\nlooked very old, tired and frightened. Savitri Devi\u2019s misery started when her husband\npassed away 14 years back. She was left alone with her four sons and three daughters.\nHowever, she engaged herself in daily wage labour works and struggled a lot for the\nupbringing of children. Now, her three sons and two daughters are married. The sons are\nresiding along with their family in different houses. And, she is staying with one of her son\nwho is studying and a mentally weak daughter. Her life is filled with gloom, grief and\nstruggle. However, her miseries double when her relatives and villagers accuse her of\nbeing a witch and held her responsible for the death of her husband. She is often abused\nand beaten badly by her relatives. And, the villagers humiliate, discriminate and deprive\nher of basic facilities. Moreover, her elder daughter who was married in Ranigunj of Gaya\ndistrict also faced similar persecution and humiliation. Her in-laws also accused her witch.\nThey abused, tortured and physically assaulted her to death on complaining to the police.\nHowever, now her in-laws are in prison. Savitri Devi is taking care of her two grand-\ndaughters. With a grief stricken tone, Savitri Devi stated that till the time her husband\nwas alive, no one was addressing her witch. The moment he died, her life changed; even\nher sons are not supporting her. All this could have not happened to her , had her sons\nbeen most supportive to her.\nThere are several other cases where dejection, pain, avoidance, separation from the loved\nones is the outcome of the accusation. This is evident from the case of Ms.Jyoti Devi w/o\nShri Phunchagi Turi in village Simuratiapanna of Giridih district in Jharkhand.Jyoti Devi is a\nscheduled caste woman of Simuratiapanna village of Giridih district, Jharkhand. She is a\nsmart, hard working and knowledgeable woman. She makes efforts to keep her house\nclean and beautiful. Her in-laws who belong to simple family background were pleased\nwith her. But, sometimes, she was abused by her sister-in-laws. Nevertheless, her misery\nstarted 13 years back when one of her sister-in-laws child fell ill and eventually died.\nThereafter, everything changed. Her in-laws started abusing and cursing her witch and\npracticing witchcraft. Jyoti\u2019s efforts in convincing them that she tried her level best to\ncure the child but as destined he died went in vain.\nShe was brutally tortured and harassed. On getting the news of their daughter\u2019s\nexploitation, her parents took the matter to the panchayat which was resolved then and\nthere. The situation was under control for some days. But, again, she was abused and\ntortured, not only by her family but also the other lower and upper caste people in the\nvillage. They even tried to lynch her. Her husband also started torturing her. Her parents\nwere threatened to death if they extended any moral support to their daughter. The\nintervention of local NGO there did not bring succour to her as those accusing her of\nbeing a witch were not relenting and they were not realising that death could be from a\ndisease and an outcome of someone wanting.The representatives of the Dalit Vikas Samiti\nalso tried to convince them, but failed. The extent of exploitation was such that the scar\nmarks of her wounds were still visible when CADAM team met her in course of conducting\ninterviews with the victim for this report. She revealed that, on resisting, she was tied\nwith a rope, locked in a room and mercilessly beaten. However, one day she escaped to\nthe police station and filed a case against her in-laws. But, due to lack of witness, or one\ncan say, police biasness, the culprits were not punished. Instead, she was brutally\nphysically and mentally tortured. As a result, she had ran away to save her life and left\nbehind her children. The incident totally ruined her life and now also it haunts her\nterribly. The pain of being separated from the children is intolerable. But it is the pain\nthat Ms. Jyoti Devi was found suffering from just because all counselling available did not\ncreate conducive conditions for her to live with her children whom she carried for nine\nmonths in her womb.\nCases after cases across the states specially in the states surveyed ,stories with deep\npsychological scars resulting in poor mental health of women accused, beaten, humiliated\npublicly through forcing urine drinking and human exreta feeding have been found. Some\nof the interviews and expert analyses found in the cases and reports show the clear motive\nof the usurping the property that belongs to accused women and their children.\nAccusations are made as a ploy to force a widow to move out, go elsewhere leaving behind\nthe property of deceased which could have been claimed by the women and her children.\n52 | Page\n5.3 Summary\nTo sum up, the lower caste women, firstly, bear the curse of being a witch and then the\nhardship and agony of the atrocities and violence meted against them by the upper caste\npeople to ensure their superior position in the society. They are mercilessly beaten up and\nforced to consume human excreta and wastes. They are expelled from the family, village\nand community. The Ojhas also misled the villagers by identifying a poor and helpless\nlower caste woman or widow. Thus, allegation of witch & witchcraft, the most effective\nweapon in rural India, is used to destroy a woman\u2019s life, dignity & social prestige having\nhuge debilitating impact on the psychological wellbeing for which till date there is no\npolicy for supporting and looking after women who become victims of violence. There\nhave been direct economic losses in terms of loss of properties in cases where women\naccused of being a witch had to move to their maternal place or to the house of their\ndaughter for security and peace of mind.\n53 | Page\nCHAPTER \u2013 VI\nWITCH AND WITCH PRACTICES: AN ILLOGICAL MYTH\n6.1 Introduction\nThe phenomenon of witch and witch hunting has witnessed phases of change &\ntransformation in the society. Although, a vast majority of the rural people in India are\npossessed with the faith and believe of witch and witchcraft, a significant section of the\npopulation are in opposition to such superstitious belief. We have looked at the dimension\nof the conviction of people regarding the practice of witchcraft and the related violence\nemerging from it. But, apart from these, the perception of the people who do not believe\nin witches and witchcraft is an important aspect of the study. Their views and opinion can\ngive rise to revolutionary policies and strategies in evading the practice along with a\nchange in the mindset and behaviour of the people. With this backdrop, the present\nchapter discusses the perception and opinions of some people who do not believe in the\nexistence of witches.\n6.2 Findings of the study\n6.2.1 Reason behind the Prevalence of Witch Hunting\nAccording to the Figure 6.1, majority of the respondents (47 per cent) stated that the\nwomen who dare to protest and speak up against the social hegemonic structure are\nalways targeted as witch. Moreover, 34 per cent of the respondents reported that a\nwoman is accused a witch with an aim to denounce her from the community and have\ncontrol over her land and property. One such instance is of Rambalak Ravidas, a resident\nof Chamar Vigaha village of district of Nalanda, Bihar. He was working in the Police\nDepartment and retired in 2004. He has a daughter who is married. After retirement, he\nreturned to his village with his wife. On reaching, he was shocked to see that the door of\nhis house was locked and a wall was constructed in front of the door. This infuriated him\nand he had a confrontation with the neighbours and the villagers who disrespect and\nhumiliate the couple for not having a male child. The villagers even accuse his wife a\nwitch and discriminate and humiliate her. Since, Rambalak is without a male heir, some of\nthe villagers and relatives make efforts to grab their property also. Thus, it is a general\npractice that any family that accumulated land or property was subjected to envy and\nthose people with a claim over the land or property are often the ones who initiate witch\naccusations in order to immediately takeover the property. Many upper caste people also\ninstigate such practices against the lower caste men and women in order to maintain their\nsuperior status in the society. Furthermore, there are also instances where the accusation\nof Witch was basically due to sexual pleasure (19 per cent).\n54 | Page\n0.5 ccaassttee mmeemmbbeerrss ttaakkee pprriiddee iinn ssttiiggmmaattiizziinngg wwoommeenn ooff\nlloowweerr oorr DDaalliitt ccllaasssseess ttoo mmaaiinnttaaiinn tthheeiirr \u2018\u2018ssuuppeerriioorriittyy\u2019\u2019\n12.8\n20.7 WWoommeenn wwhhoo ddaarree ttoo pprrootteesstt aanndd ssppeeaakk uupp aaggaaiinnsstt tthhee\nssoocciiaall hheeggeemmoonniicc ssttrruuccttuurreess aarree aallssoo ttaarrggeetteedd aass ddaayyaann\n19.1\nttoo ttaakkee aawwaayy tthhee mmoovvaabbllee oorr iimmmmoovvaabbllee pprrooppeerrttyy\nfor sexual favor\n4477..33\ntthhiiss tthhee aa wwaayy ttoo ttaakkee rreevveennggee oonn pprrooppeerrttyy oorr ootthheerr\n34.0\ndispute\nOther\nFFiigguurree 66..11:: RReeaassoonnss behind the Prevalence of Witch in Society\nSource: Field Study\nLLLaaaccckkk ooofff ppprrrooopppeeerrr sssccciiieeennntttiiifffiiiccc aaawwwaaarrreeennneeessssss aaannnddd eeeddduuucccaaatttiiiooonnn aaarrreee ooonnneee ooofff ttthhheee rrreeeaaasssooonnnsss ooofff lllaaarrrgggeee-scale\nppprrreeevvvaaallleeennnccceee ooofff wwwiiitttccchhh hhhuuunnntttiiinnnggg iiinnn IIInnndddiiiaaa...

Upon categorizing them as\n\u2018daayan\u2019, and causing their ostracism from the village or compelling them to leave their\nresidence, it becomes easier for them to forcibly acquire and hawk on the relinquished\nproperty\u201d. Thus, it can be inferred from the above responses that the upper castes\nintentions in ensuring their position and dominance in the social hierarchy leads to the\naccusation and persecution of witch hunting.\n6.2.2 Intention of Ojhas\nIt is highly evident from various studies that the practice of witch hunting has become a\nsocial and religious business for the local doctors/medicine men/Ojhas. The Ojhas take\nadvantage of the situation and create differences between villagers to fulfil their\nmaterialistic requirements. In spite of the development of various health care facilities in\nthe villages, people are still influenced by the fraud Ojhas. The Ojhas exploit the villagers\nsocially, economically and physically to fulfil their egotistic and selfish desires. The\ninterviewed doctors, ward members, sarpanch, journalists, social worker, etc. reported\nthat the Ojhas also mislead the villagers by identifying mostly poor and helpless widows of\nlower castes. Along with creating disputes and differences between villagers, family and\nindividuals, the Ojhas simultaneously demand a handsome amount for the treatment. The\nFigure 6.3 reveals that out of the total people who do not believe in witchcraft, 77 per\ncent reported that ojha takes bribe to accuse a woman as witch. However, all the\ninterviewers of Giridih district reported of similar response.\n100.0\n78.6 66.7 87.5 82.4 79.2 88.2 64.7 73.1 78.3 81.8 76.2 72.7 77.3 76.6\nFigure 6.3: Respondents believe that the Ojha Demands Bribe for Accusing Women as\nWitch\nSource: Field Study\nOne such instance is of Ms. Rita Devi, a resident of Shahapur village, was married to Anuj\nManjhi 20 years back. After giving birth to a daughter, she frequently suffered from ill\nhealth. They consulted the doctor but she could not be recovered. Finally, the family\nmembers took her to the ojha for treatment. The ojha informed that Rita Devi is being\npossessed by a witch who is her own relative. The witch will cast evil spells, as a result of\nwhich she might also die. The ojha advised them to perform two religious rites to get rid\nof the witch. On agreeing, they gave Rs. 1500 to the ojha for the rites. Apart from\ndemanding a goat, a pig, two hen and new clothes, the ojha demanded Rs. 30,000 for\nperforming the rites & offerings.\nFiled Survey by NACDOR Team, Nlanda District, Bihar\n6.2.3 Role of Family/Community/caste, panchayat, enforcement agencies in\npreventing/abetting these practices\nRole of Family/Community/Caste:\n56 | Page\nFamily members have been found to behind the accusations for women being a witch for\nvarious reasons. Ignorance is one disease and death and its causative factors is one of\nthem. Usurping property is one of the main reported in several of cases. According the\nnews entitled \u2018Witch-hunting is not about the superstition\u2019 published in Indian New from\nKolkata on May 9,2013, Women are lynched, sexually exploited and forcibly evicted from\ntheir homes after being branded witches. Witch-hunting is not about a stray report tucked\naway in a corner of the newspaper but an increasingly worrying pan-India trend that\nspecifically targets women in a patriarchal society, say experts. With reports of witch-\nhunting coming in from villages and even towns across the country, sociologists, women\nactivists and others believe that it but another form of gender-based violence. And women\nwho stand out from the crowd, either because they have property, are good looking or\nindependent are specifically targeted.\nThere have been increased instances of single women/widows being branded witches and\nmurdered when they refused sexual overtures of someone dominant in the village or in the\nfamily. In some cases, relatives branded them witches to grab their property.NGOs\nworking in rural areas have found \"beauty and wealth\" to be the prime reasons behind\nwitch-hunts.\n\"It is less of superstition and more of a conspiracy, either to grab the property of the\nwoman or to take revenge for unfulfilled sexual intent in the case of younger women,\"\nsocial activist Shravani is reported to have told IANS. According to Shravani , Ms. Saloni\nKujur of Mandar village, an educated single woman, was branded a witch and killed\nbecause her relative wanted to grab her property and they could not tolerate a woman\nbeing the heir of her father's property and people don't want to see women being self-\ndependent,\".\nRole of Panchayats:\nFrom the analysis of the case studies, there are several instances when FIR is not lodged\npersecution of women resulting from the accusation of being a witch is hushed up and\nsorted out locally by Panchayats. This was evident from the discussion with Sarpanches in\nJharkhand .Panchayat leaders were found interested in sorting out the cases locally but\nthey in doing so did not realise that through making compromises, they are not ensuring\nthe elimination of the violence on women as a result of a very serious accusation and\nspecially when there is violence on the women accused. Such compromises may be\nassessed for the impact in order to have a clear impact on the incidence of violence on SC\nand ST women. Sorting out the cases by Panchayats does not generate awareness on the\npunishment for Dalit women exploitation\nDespite presence of women who suffer the accusation of being a \u2018Dayan\u2019 /witch, there is a\ntendency to deny its existence since the number of the incidence is not very significant.\nThis became evident when Ms. Chunni Kumari, an activist of Rashtriya Dalit Mahila\nAndolan , associated with National Confederation of Dalit Organisation visited police\nstation of Makhdoompur in district of Jehanabad in the state of Bihar, India. The visit was\nmade on the occasion of the meeting with the Sarpanches in the area on the occasion of\nHoli. Chunni Kumari introduced the purpose of visiting the police station in order to learn\n57 | Page\non the reports that may have reached the police. First of all Sarpanches said that they did\nnot know about such instance. However, when Ms. Chunni Kumari insisted on the story of a\nwidows like Sarita Devi in the villages within Makhdoompur police region. Initially,\nSarpanches did not accept that there is any instance of witch hunting .The Assistant Sub\nInspector said that he did not know of any report. While the discussion was going on with\nthe detailed sharing by Ms.Chunni Kumari, one of the sarpanch came who said he knew on\nthe instance of women suffering from the accusations of being a witch. He informed that\nthere are cases of women accused of being a witch. He informed that a case has come to\nhim but the same was sorted out at village panchayat level. The case involved the same\ncaste. He further informed that the cases are generally reported from the so called low\ncastes. According to him, the cases sorted out at panchayat level is better rather than\ngetting the issues in the hand of police since people on both sides get harassed if a case is\nfiled and that case goes on and one without speedy delivery of justice. The person who\nhad persecuted the woman calling her witch dayan was socially punished and the accused\nwomen was compensated for the economic losses that were incurred. He said if the\noppressor party would not have accepted than the matter would have been taken to\npolice. Reflecting on the social and economic profile of women, Sarpanch said it is\ngenerally low wealth group women who are accused of being a Dayan and then generally\naccusations came from the same caste groups and not from others. He said, in his\nlifetime, he has not heard about the incidence of this happening in the higher caste\nwomen.\nMs.Chunni Kumari, RDMA activist said that with the local sorting out of the issues, there is\na negative outcome that is possible. People are not made aware that accusations being a\nwitch are a crime and there are punishments for the same. Also, she highlighted the need\nfor making awareness on the legal provisions which Sarpanches accepted. They all\naccepted that awareness meetings need to be organised in order to ensure that women\nare not persecuted through levelling the accusation of being a witch/Dayan. She\nhighlighted that through these accusations, women are exploited. In the discussion with\nthe police inspector, he shared that case of women being persecuted through the\naccusation of being a witch has not reached him but he is aware of the presence of Ojhas\nwho are reached by people for sorting out health related and other problems in\nanticipation of change in the situation that is found troubling. He informed that in Gaya\ndistrict, there is a place where a fair of ghost is being organised where people go to meet\nOjhas for sorting out problems. On the understanding of the reasons for the existence of\nOjhas, the Police Inspector was aware that Ojhas are found across the castes and they are\nusing the existence of the problems for ensuring their psychological influence. In the\nprocess of delivering their remedies, there are Ojhas who are seeking money along with\nthe meat, intoxicating drinks and several other items that they call for performing\nincantations that are part of their remedies. Considering the mental health perspective,\nit is clear that psychological problems and problems of relationships and other injustices\nthat are part of the social existence are being sought to be remedied with the help of\nOjhas. He informed that whenever there is an instance of exploitation, he is visiting the\nplaces. On discussion the legal provision, it became clear that punishment is not severe for\nthe oppressors. On the query for the possession of the act, deputy station officer informed\nthat he did not have a copy of the Act. On the discussion on awareness programme, he\nagreed that joint work is needed in order to ensure minimisation of violence against Dalit\n58 | Page\nwomen through the accusation of being a Dayan. Sarpanches and deputy station in charge\nexpressed their full support if RDMA and CADAM were to organise awareness programme\nfor ensuring elimination of oppression of Dalit women through accusation of being a witch.\nRole of Enforcement agencies in preventing /abetting in the crime:\nInterview with police officials show that all the cases are not registered. There are\noccasion when police officials are letting off the perpetrators through taking money for\nthe same. There are instances where police officials have prevented perpetration of\nviolence. All this was evident in the interview with Interview with Hirankant Jha, Munshi,\nPolice Station, Nawada City, District, Nawada, Bihar. He informed that a case of death of\nboy was attributed to woman who was accused of being being a witch. When it was\ninvestigated, it was found that death of a boy happening to his suffering Injuries due to\nfall from a tree which was attributed falsely to a woman accused on being a witch. In\nanother instance a case of HIV AIDS victim dying from AIDS was attributed to witch. Police\ninvestigation exposed truth. These facts became clear in the interview with Mr.Hirakant\nJha, a clerk at Nawada police station in Bihar. The purpose of the interview was to learn\non the data related to reports on the persecution of women as a result of the accusation\nof Dayan. He informed that only one case has been reported since he joined the police\nstation. He did not have the report from earlier period. For him, police station is place of\ncompromise and when cases are coming then FIR is not registered. But according to him if\nthere is someone reported to have beaten a woman, then he is called to the police station\nand beaten and then left. On the use of influence, there are some who wish to influence\nthe police but then, due course of laws are followed considering the legal rights of women\nto protection from violence. On the social profile of people who are reporting the case of\nDayan, he said that these cases are from the scheduled castes. There are times when\nreason of death is not known properly as this happened once when a boy passed away and\nthen there were some who reported that a Dayan has been involved . When the matter\nwas investigated, it was found that boy had fallen from a tree. There are incidences when\nupper caste people accuse SC and ST women for oppressing them. He felt that an honest\npolice officer can deliver justice but for extorting money from those persecuted women,\nthere are instance when police officials are seen to be covering up the fact after receiving\nbribe for the same.\nThus, it is important to ensure those police officials bound with the duties are particular\nin delivering justice. He confessed that instance of beating and mental torture through\nleveling the accusation of being a Dayan is generally not recorded. Person is called,\nrebuked and then let off. On the query for sufficiency of the legal provisions, he said laws\nare enough for preventing atrocities on women. Informing on the case from SIkandarpur\nvillage, he informed that a man living in Gujarat used to come after every two years and\nthe contracted AIDS and passed away before Holi. An old woman was being accused of\nbeing a dayan. She reported this to police and then police became active. Finding the\nreality, police asked the wife of the dead man to testify that he had AIDS that he\ncontracted due to unsafe sex with other women. Concluding the interview, it was\nobserved that upper caste people are also engaged in using this work for oppressing Dalits.\nAlso SC and ST being the poorest and illiterate are more prone to accuse women being a\nDayan /Witch.\n59 | Page\n6.2.4 RReemmeeddiieess ttoo EElliimmiinnaattee Ignorance Generated Social Evil of AAccccuussiinngg WWoommeenn ooff\nWitchcraft\nThe practice ooff wwiittcchh hhuunnttiinngg iiss aa ssoocciiaall eevviill iinn tthhee ssoocciieettyy wwhhiicchh hhaass bbeeeenn ggeenneerraatteedd aass aa\nrreessuulltt ooff iiggnnoorraannccee oonn rreeaassoonnss oonn ddeeaatthh aanndd ddiisseeaassee aanndd llaacckk ooff aacccceessss ttoo qquuaalliittyy hheeaalltthh\ncare in rural areas..

If education and access to\ncomprehensive health care were ensured, incidence of the violence of women due to\nignorance would be substantially reduced. The malicious intention of the Ojhas also adds\non to the destitution and anguish of the women who have been functioning in the villages\nover the year prescribing processes for death and disease for which he did not have any\nother way but to ascribe the reasons to external agencies and powers . Efforts should be\nmade to aware and educate the common people on the evil effects of witch hunting in\nsociety. Considering the deficit in access to health care, it is important to ensure that\nmental health care and support reaches villages with the appointment of psychiatrists and\npsychologists at the block level while ensuring delivery of justice to accused women\nthrough all mean with accelerated programmatic and policy action. Comprehensive\napproach consisting of legal remedies, psychosocial support, economic empowerment,\neducation, persecution of the perpetrator of violence is the urgent need to hour if India\nhas to achieve better indicators in human development. Practice of caste based\ndiscrimination will have to be eradicated addressing the root cause with the involvement\nof all in government, civil society, academia, judiciary, police ,health service delivery,\nlocal government institutions\n61 | Page\nCHAPTER - VII\nINSTITUTIONAL, SOCIAL MECHANISMS AND POLICY INIATIVES\n7.1 Introduction\nThe previous chapters have illustrated how people have a firm and strong believe in Witch\nHunting and how violence against women related to witch hunting continues unabated in\nJharkhand, Bihar and Odisha. The question which arises in this situation is what have been\nthe measures and strategies to combat such form of violence against women? The present\nchapter deals with the knowledge and awareness of the people regarding the witch\nhunting laws and regulations and the steps to be adopted to overcome such a practice in\nthe society. It also de the various measures adopted by the government to address the\nissue. It will also assess the role of community based organizations (CBOs), civil society\norganizations (CSOs), NGOs, local and state level authorities working in the studied area.\nLast but not the least, the chapter will also discuss about the measures to be taken to end\nsuch a practice.\n7.1.1. Policy Level Initiatives:\nRecently, the Government of India introduced \"The Protection from Domestic Violence\nBill 2002\". The Bill (Section 4) defines domestic violence as a conduct whereby the abuser\nhabitually assaults the person, makes his/her life miserable by his conduct, forces him/her\nto lead an immoral life and otherwise injures or harms the person (GOI, 2002). However,\nthis law is only about the domestic violence and does not mention community violence as\nwell as witch-hunting. However, the increasing rate of crimes against women related to\nwitch hunting and tireless efforts by NGOs and civil society organizations has compelled\nsome states in India to formulate necessary legislation against this appalling practice.\nBihar, was the first state in India to pass a law against witch hunting. The Bihar\ngovernment passed a law in 1999 called the \u201cPrevention of Witch (Dayan) Practices Act,\n1999\u201d. Jharkhand followed it with the \u201cAnti Witchcraft Act in 2001\u201d. The \u201cChhattisgarh\nTonhi Pratarna Bill 2005\u201d (Chhattisgarh Prevention of Atrocities on Women in the name\nof Tonhi) was formulated in 2005 followed by Rajasthan in 2006. The provision of the law\ntakes very serious action if anyone tries to identify or instigate others to identify a woman\nas a witch. If a person alleges a woman to be a witch, he/she faces imprisonment for up to\nthree months. If a person declares a woman as a witch or participates in torture, he/she is\nimposed fines ranging from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 2,000 or imprisonment for up to a year without\nbail. But, in reality, the Acts has proved unable to provide for effective preventative,\ncurative, or punitive measures for women who have been labelled as witches. Despite the\npresence of these Acts, people accused as witches, particularly in the studied states of\nJharkhand, Bihar and Odisha have been persecuted, tortured, and murdered and the\npractice continues today. Though people claim to have knowledge about the laws of witch\nhunting, but in reality they do not have any idea about the laws. Every year, hundreds of\npeople, often older women, are accused as witches or \u2018Daayans\u2019, often abused, cast out\nof their families and communities and are, in many cases, murdered.\n7.2 Findings of the Study\n7.2.1 Legal Awareness\nThe present study interrogated the people regarding the level of knowledge and\nawareness on the laws of witch hunting. It was revealed that 78 per cent of the\n62 | Page\nhhhooouuussseeehhhooollldddsss aaarrreee aaawwwaaarrreee ooofff ttthhheee llleeegggaaalll ppprrrooovvviiisssiiiooonnnsss ooofff wwwiiitttccchhh hhhuuunnntttiiinnnggg (((FFFiiiggguuurrreee 777...111)))...

She is a smart, hard working and knowledgeable woman. Her\nmisery started 13 years back when one of her sister-in-laws child fell ill and eventually\ndied. Thereafter, everything changed. Her in-laws started abusing and cursing her witch\nand practicing witchcraft. Jyoti\u2019s efforts in convincing them that she tried her level best\nto cure the child but as destined he died went in vain. She was brutally tortured and\nharassed. Her parents took the matter to the panchayat which was resolved then and\nthere. The situation was under control for some days. But, again, she was harassed, not\nonly by her husband and family but also the other lower and upper caste people in the\nvillage. They even tried to lynch her. Her parents were threatened to death if they\nsupport their daughter. The representatives of the Dalit Vikas Samiti also tried to convince\nthem, but failed. The extent of exploitation was such that the scar marks of her wounds\nwere still visible. However, one day she escaped to the police station and filed a case\nagainst her in-laws. But, due to lack of witness, or one can say, police biasness, the\nculprits were not punished. Unable to bear the torture, she ran away from her house to\nsave her life leaving behind her children. The incident totally ruined her life and now also\nit haunts her terribly. The pain of being separated from the children is intolerable.\nSource: Filed Survey by NACDOR Team, Simuratiapanna village of Giridih district, Jharkhand\n7.2.3 Severity of Punishment\nThe perpetrators of witch hunting are imprisoned only for a year or fined up to Rs. 1000 to\nRs. 2000 according to the witch hunting Acts.

The threat of punishment and\nconviction hasn\u2019t been a deterrent since the perpetrators of the crime (always male,\nmostly upper caste Hindus) know that they could not be punished as any FIRs or written\ncomplaints are lodged. Thus, it is because of lack of laws or rather powerless laws and\ntheir weak implementation that specifically targets this practice. Furthermore, the\nintervention of police and authorities in such cases is negligible. The victims, often,\ndisagree to lodge complaint due to social stigma. This instigates the perpetrators to\nrepeat such incidences. Therefore, there is need to aware, motivate and sensitize people\nagainst such practice along with implementing better health, educational and employment\nfacilities.\n67 | Page\nCHAPTER - VIII\nCONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATIONS\nWitch-hunting is one of the worst forms of cultural violence against women in India and\nother developing countries. Witch hunting is manifestation of violence against women that\nis practiced in the name of culture, religion and social norms and practices, which are\nusually overlooked by the society. It is a baseless and illogical superstition which entails\ndeath of women. Women in India, particularly, the Dalits and Adivasis have unequal access\nto productive resources, food and health care, education, employment opportunities,\njudicial system, etc. which makes them vulnerable to possible abuses, including\nallegations of being witches. Furthermore, widowhood is perceived to be inauspicious in\nupper caste Hindu society. However, because of the Sanskritization process, other lower\ncastes also started to adhere to strict Hindu practices. Thus, this process has also made\nwomen belonging to other castes vulnerable. From the cases, it is seen that many widows\nand single women were victims of witchcraft allegations.\nIn patriarchal societies, women face different kinds of discrimination and exploitation.\nAlthough there are some maintenance rights, but, in the event of the death of their\nspouses, relatives and neighbours illegally acquire the land, accuse the women of\nwitchcraft, leading to torture and death. Moreover, there are no provisions for providing\nrehabilitation, relief, or any form of compensation to women after they have been\nidentified and persecuted as witches. Thus, in many cases, even if FIRs are lodged and an\narrest is made, the culprit is either freed due to lack of witness or influence of upper\ncaste people. However, in any circumstances, the woman is still left to bear the brunt of\nher injuries, or the social stigma faced by the villagers. Often women continue to live\nostracized from their villages and their lands, with no means of sustenance. In cases\nwhere the woman is murdered, her next of kin do not even get any form of compensation\nor relief. Thus, it is evident from the case studies that the uneducated people have a firm\nbelief in the practice and also the local doctor (Ojhas) who mislead the villagers due to\nfulfilment of his personal and materialistic needs. The involvement of the authorities and\npolice is negligible.\nHowever, apart from witch allegation on lower caste women, the study also unveiled the\nfact that the lower caste men are also victim of witch accusation. One such instance is of\nAbba Mia, aged 70 years of Bagadabera village of Deogarh district. In 2011, Abba Mia\npassed away due to violence and atrocity meted against him for practicing witchcraft.\nAbba Mia has four daughters and a son. His son, Niam Ansari stated that their neighbour\nKadir Mia, Nehru Biwi and some villagers accused Abba Mia of casting evil spells and black\nmagic on their son who eventually died. They brutally tortured and beat him mercilessly\nto death. After his death, his family registered the case against them and finally they\nwere found guilty and put behind the bars. However, Abba Mia\u2019s family did not receive\nany compensation from the government. There are also instances of lower caste man\nbeing alleged as ojha and doing harm to the villagers. Mahendra Majhi, aged 60 years, is a\nresident of Jehanabad district, Bihar. He belongs to a lower caste, Majhi. He stated that\nhis grandmother and father was devotee of goddess Durga. The villagers\u2019 belief that his\n68 | Page\ngrandmother was also often possessed with the goddess. They used to seek advice and\ntreatment for themselves and their family\u2019s ill health. After her death, Mahendra\u2019s father\ncontinued the profession of ojha and people believed him. However, after his death, the\nwork discontinued since no one in the family had knowledge about it. Mahendra engaged\nhimself in daily wage labour works. He had the burden of nurturing his two daughters after\nthe sudden death of his wife. Since, his grandmother and father were Ojhas, so he was\nalso forcibly alleged an ojha. The villagers blame him for any mishappening in the village.\nThey think that he is practicing witchcraft on the victims and brutally assault him. He\neven did not get any help from the Panchayat or Sarpanch.\nThus, after analyzing the cause and effect of witch-hunting in the states, it is inferred\nthat there exist class and caste based discrimination along with gender-based\ndiscrimination in the society in the name of Witch Hunting. The major reason for the\nprevalence of such practices can be attributed to accumulation of economic belongings,\ndominance in social hierarchy, sexual dissatisfaction and personal vendetta. The roles and\nresponsibilities of the police and the local authorities have been negligible in overcoming\nthe practice. However, various NGOs, CBOs, social workers and self-help groups are\nmaking sincere efforts to curtail the practice through awareness campaigns, but their\nefforts needs to be supplemented by proper implementation of Government Acts and\nschemes and support from the authorities.\nThe study shows that violence against women in the name of whicth is a burning issue.\nThough the Government of India has enacted various legislations like incorporation of\nsection 498A in the IPC, Dowry Prohibition Act, Child Marriage Prevention Act, Prevention\nof Immoral Traffic Act, and Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 to\ndeal with various offences against women, still there are various situations encountered by\nwomen wherein they are subjected to torture and atrocities. There are specific laws\ndealing in those areas e.g. in certain areas women are accused of performing witchcraft\nand unnecessarily being harassed in the name of witch hunting. At least 12 states \u2014\nJharkhand, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan,\nAndhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Assam and Bihar \u2014 are recognized as areas where\nwitch hunts are rampant even today.\n\u2018Witch hunting\u2019 involves the branding of women as witches, mostly after an \u2018ojha\u2019 or\nwitch doctor confirms that a woman is a witch. A woman who is branded a witch is then\nsubjected to numerous forms of torture: beatings, burns, being paraded naked through the\nvillage, being forced to eat human excrement, raped, having wooden or sharp objects\ninserted in her private parts. In some cases her hair is cut off, her teeth are pulled out\n(she is supposedly \u2018defanged\u2019), in some instances her nose or other body-parts are cut off,\nshe and her children are socially ostracized, her land and property is seized, and\nsometimes women are even put to death and their limbs hacked off. Witch hunting is\nwidely seen to be used as \u2018a pretext for suppressing women and gaining personal interest.\u2019\nIn the tribal villages of Jharkahnd, Bihar and Odisha the village \u2018ojhas\u2019 (known as\n\u2018sorcerers\u2019) boast of their powers to detect a witch \u2013 but they will only do so \u201cfor a\nprice.\u201d For the overly greedy ojha to declare a woman a witch, villagers simply need to\ncough up a goat, a bottle of liquor, or any other poultry animal to pay the ojha. When\nwomen reject the sexual advances of their male neighbors, it is another cause on the list\n69 | Page\nleading to allegations of witchcraft. Widows who refuse to relinquish claim over their\nhusband\u2019s property can similarly be threatened and charged with being a witch; an act\nthat often succeeds to compel them to let go of their claim on their husband\u2019s land. So we\ncan connects the practice of witch-hunting to the prevalence of patriarchal attitudes,\nstating that an opposition to women\u2019s rights over property, a general suspicion of female\nsexuality, as well as a lack of education and health services have contributed to the\ncontinuation of the antiquated practice of branding women witches. Therefore, real\nreasons why women are branded witches are economic gain or sexual vengeance.\nThe critical point is that women, who are accused of witchcraft in India, will often not\nseek any legal or police assistance. Shame, isolation and poverty feed the wheel of no\nprotection, no rights and no dignity for women who are usually on the bottom layer of\nIndian society and already without any proper legal recourse. There are no provisions for\nproviding rehabilitation, relief, or any form of compensation to women after they have\nbeen identified as witches. Thus in many cases, even if FIRs are lodged and an arrest is\nmade, the woman is still left to bear the brunt of her injuries, or the social stigma she is\nstill faced with from others in the village. Often women continue to live ostracized from\ntheir villages and their lands, with no means of sustenance. In cases where the woman is\nmurdered, her next of kin do not even get any form of compensation or relief.\nThe descriptions of the killings are hair-raising and horrifying to the point of insanity. In\nmost cases women are beaten until they fall unconscious and forced to eat their own\nexcreta or drink urine before being burnt alive. In some places they are also stripped and\nparaded naked. Of late, it has also been observed that most killings have a common\npattern: the victims are always poor, mostly from marginalized communities and own\nsome property.The killings occur when women try to resist attempts to grab their\nproperty, or refuse sexual favors demanded by men who have dominant position in the\ncommunity. The brutality that follows, therefore, is an act of \u2018punishment\u2019 to the women\nfor being rebellious.\nIf we look at national laws, most witch hunt cases are dealt with by Section 323 of the\nIndian Penal Code (IPC), which prescribes one year\u2019s imprisonment and a Rs 1,000 fine to\nanyone who causes harm voluntarily. In other words, the punishment for brutalising a\nwoman by calling her a witch could be the same as that for slapping a person. Other\nsections like 302 (murder) of the IPC are invoked in witch hunt cases that lead to a\nwoman\u2019s death. Therefore, there is an immediate need for enacting a National Law on\nwitch hunting. In the light of the discussion, it is necessary to provide some\nrecommendations classified by implementing agencies which are as follows:\nCentral Government:\n\u2022 The Union Ministry of Women and Child Development should organise a national\nconsultation to develop an act to provide for more effective measures to prevent\nand protect the women from witch hunt practices and to eliminate their torture,\noppression, humiliation and killing by the society by trial of offences related to witch\nhunt practices and providing for punishment and, for the relief and rehabilitation of\nwomen victim of such offences and for any other matters connected therewith or\nincidental thereto.\n70 | Page\n\u2022 Considering the continuation of incidence of violence against women , there is need\nallocate budgets for Dalit, minority and Adivasi led NGOs so that awareness\nprogrammes and campaigns are conducted to aware people about the debilitating\npsychological and economic impacts on women who are made victim of accusations\nof being a witch.\n\u2022 Special budget for adult education curriculum in the regions in order to engage\nwomen in understanding the reason of death and disease that are attributed to\nwomen accusing them of being a witch. Adult education should be incentivised for\nensuring participation of all illiterate women in order to ensure that that they are\nnot vulnerable to suggestions of those who are prone to make unscientific\nprescriptions. ASHA should be trained in preventing false accusations reporting on it\nrapidly to health personnel.\n\u2022 Support awareness programmes for eliminating witch hunting to alter the deep-\nrooted value system of patriarchy that discriminate and subordinate women. There is\nalso need for organising padyatras . NGOs and media have an important role to play\nin disseminating awareness and advocacy to change such defective value systems\nfrom society. Central Government needs to create a mission mode programme for\nensuring zero report on the incidence for witch hunting through social audits\nconducted by reputed Dalit, Adivasi and women organisations.\n\u2022 Ministry of Panchayat Raj should be creating special budget for training of the\npanchayat leaders in handling the reports on witch hunting and taking all preventive\nmeasures in order to ensure zero incidence of witch accusation related violence on\nwomen. Panchayat level training module should be made for step by step\ncommunication and action patterns for the accusation of witchcraft for women.\n\u2022 Central Government should declare Dr.B.R.Ambedkar Social Justice Award for\nSarpanches who ensure zero incidence of the witch hunting and caste based\natrocities and discrimination. Indicators for award should include specific activities\nand its frequency targeted for eliminating violence of SC, ST, minority\u2019s men and\nwomen who are accused of witchcraft or casting evil spell.\n\u2022 The study has shown that witch hunting violence is not formally recorded in many\ncases. There is a need to address the issues rapidly through seeking report through\nsocial audits on the instance of cases where police did not report the cases.\nAccountability needs to affixed and due action needs to against negligence of duty.\nViolence against women through witch hunting cannot be condoned.\n\u2022 Ministry of Human Resource Development should be ensuring opening Department of\nPsychology in all the colleges in order to ensure availability of Clinical Psychologists\nat block level hospitals. University Grant Commission should be mandated for a\ntargeted introduction of Department of Psychology across the universities in order to\ngenerate human resource for addressing the issues of psychological damage that are\ngenerated from widespread practice of caste based discrimination, untouchability\nand violence against SC and ST women.\n\u2022 In the interim, NRHM should have component for time bound training of all the health\nworkers specially ASHAs at the village level in order to ensure that mental illness\nissues are reported objectively and due psychological and psychiatric assistance is\nprovided to cases reported by the ASHAs.\n71 | Page\nState Government\n\u2022 The study reveals that in Nalanda district of Bihar only 44.7 % households have\ntheir own hand pump followed by Rohtas 52 % Nawada 72 %, Jahanabad 23.1 %.\nTherefore, the state government should taken immediate step to install handpump\nand suppy piple water in Dalit habitations of these districts to resolve drinking\nwater problem.\n\u2022 In Odisha stare of Koraput district only 16 % Dalits have acsses to local handpump\nfollowed by Gajpati 36 %, Sonepur 56 %. It was also found that the Dalit women\nare subjected to violence and atrocities while fetching water from a distance\nsoucrce owned by dominant caste. Therefore it is recommended that the\ngovernment of Odisha should supply drinking immediately in those districts. This\nwill contribute in reducing the violence against women.\n\u2022 In Dumka district of Jharkhand only 36 % Dalits and Adivasi household have acess\nto local handump followed by Giridih 20 %, Hazaribagh 27.1 % and Deoghar 36 %.\nTherefore, the government of Jharkhand should suppy drinking water to these\ndistricts immediately.\n\u2022 The study revealed that the incidence of witch is highest in Odisha followed by\nJharkhand and Bihar in the last 10 years.

All the\n72 | Page\napplicable legal provision should be applied to the perpetrators of violence against\nwomen accusing them of being witch.\n\u2022 Copies of laws against witchcraft should be made available to all panchayats and\nthis should be available with all the police stations.\n\u2022 Special budget should be given to police stations for travel related to violence\nagainst SC, ST women that are reported.\n\u2022 Police officials and panchayat leaders not delivering justice should be punished.\n\u2022 Social and economic losses and psychological damage should be compensated by\nthe state.\n\u2022 Government should aim to enforce free universal (at primary, secondary and\ntertiary levels) female education. There is need to introduce the subject of\nwitchcraft in school textbooks to raise awareness among school children about the\nancient practice of witch hunting based on superstitious beliefs, so that it can\neventually be discredited and eradicated.\n\u2022 School based programme for science and health education with innovative use of\ncommunication engaging children so that children become defender of women\nrights against all kinds of violence.\n\u2022 Government should formulate employment policies and opportunities to enable\nwomen to participate in the labour market for gainful occupation in all sectors,\nformal and informal.

Free legal aid\nshould be provided to the poor and needy women. NGOs should also provide such\nlegal aid to those women who have fallen victims to abuses on charges of alleged\nwitchcraft practices.\n\u2022 Government should raise the quota system for women in all tiers of government for\ntheir socioeconomic uplift.\nLocal Self Government:\n73 | Page\n\u2022 Panchayat leaders should be ensuring delivery of justice through due punishment as\nper the law for those engaged in the violence against women accused of being a\nwitch.\n\u2022 All social groups should be encouraged to ensure that accusations are not made for\nwomen.\n\u2022 Panchayat leaders being responsible for the development of panchayat should be\nalert to the signs and information on the potential perpetrators in order to prevent\nthe incidence of violence.\n\u2022 Panchayats leaders should be encouraged to travel through the panchayat once a\nweek in order to ensure information and news on the potential perpetrators is not\nignored. Strategy should be contradicting the accusation at the right time so that\nviolence on women as a result of accusation does not take place and those making\nthe accusation are shamed and educated on the correct reason for death and\nillness through post mortem and scientific investigation.\n\u2022 Mandatory post mortems should be ensured for the deaths that are attributed to\nwitchcraft in order to debunk the idea that death could be related to witchcraft or\nsome magical influence.\n\u2022 Panchayat leader should be trained for identifying the special health related\nproblems so that they are aware of the psychiatric and psychological condition of\nwomen and men whose conditions are wrongly attributed to magic, witchcraft and\nso on.\n\u2022 Panchayat leaders should be made aware that psychological and psychiatric\nconditions are developed due to various factors and due to ignorance on the\netiology of diseases, there are instance of unscientific diagnosis.

Human Rights in India\nStatus Report\n78 | Page\nANNEXURE\u2013I\nData on Violence against Dalit Women\nIt has been rightly said that a caste society is inherently violent in nature and this\nviolenceis most brutal and horrific towards Dalit women.\nViolence against women takes a horrific form when gender and caste intersect. Vulnerably\npositioned at the bottom of India\u2019s caste, class and gender hierarchies, Dalit women\nexperience endemic gender-and-caste discrimination and violence as the outcome of\nseverely imbalanced social, economic and political power equations. Their socio-economic\nvulnerability and lack of political voice, when combined with the dominant risk factors of\nbeing Dalit and female, increase their exposure to potentially violent situations while\nsimultaneously reducing their ability to escape. Violence against Dalit women presents\nclear evidence of widespread exploitation and discrimination against these women\nsubordinated in terms of power relations to men in a patriarchal society, as also against\ntheir communities based on caste.\nIn 2007, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) delivered its\nconcluding observations regarding India\u2019s compliance with the International Convention on\nthe Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD). The Committee\u2019s report\nfound that \u2018de facto segregation of Dalits persists\u2019 and highlighted systematic abuse\nagainst Dalits including torture and extrajudicial killings, and an \u2018alarming\u2019 extent of\nsexual violence against Dalit women. The concluding observation of the committee\nconfirms that India has failed to properly protect Dalits and tribal communities26.\nIndia is a signatory to many international declarations which obligates it to protect any\nform of human rights violation. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights27 states that\n\"everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without\ndistinction of any kind, such as race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other\nopinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\" (Article 2) Similarly The\nDeclaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women28 defines violence against\nwomen as \u201cany act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in,\nphysical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such\nacts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private\nlife.\" (Article 1) It further asserts that states have an obligation to \" exercise due diligence\nto prevent, investigate and, in accordance with national legislation, punish acts of\nviolence against women, whether those acts are perpetrated by the State or by private\npersons.\" (Article 4-c) The Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination\nAgainst Women (CEDAW)29, defines discrimination against women as any \"distinction,\nexclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of\nimpairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of\ntheir marital status, on the basis of equality between men and women, of human rights or\nfundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field.\"\n(Article 1). However, deeply ingrained normative values of appropriate gender and caste\n26 Human Right Watch, 2007\n27 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 10th December\n1948, as a result of the devastations and atrocities caused by the Second World War. It was vow made by the\ninternational community that such experience should not happen again\n28 The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women was adopted by the UN General\nassembly on 20th December 1993 as a recognition of the \u2018the urgent need for the universal application to\nwomen of the rights and principles with regard to equality, security, liberty, integrity and dignity of all\nhuman beings.\u2019\n29 The Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), is an\ninternational treaty adopted in 1979 by the UN General Assembly. Described as an international bill of\nrights for women, it came into force on 3rd September 1981.\n79 | Page\nroles and behaviour patterns influence government officials, police and even judges who\nhave the power to interpret and actualize rights. These socio-culturally-religiously rooted\nbiases enforce the discriminatory status quo to the detriment of Dalit women\u2019s right to\njustice where violence takes place.\nThe violation of the human rights of the Dalit women often takes extremely demeaning\nand deplorable forms. Stripping naked, naked parading, accused of witch craft and black-\nmagic, caste abuses, pulling out nails and hair, made to eat vile substances, sexual slavery\n& bondage are some of the few forms that are often employed in the violence against\nDalit women. Further Dalit women are subjected to various kinds of sexual violence such\nas rape, molestation, kidnapping, abduction, homicide, physical and mental torture,\nimmoral traffic and sexual abuse. The National Crime Records Bureau30 data records reveal\nthat more than 4 Dalit women are raped every day in India.\nMost often Dalit women are seen as the representative of their caste and violence against\nthem is used as a means of punishment and demonstration of power by the dominant\ncastes towards both the woman herself and her community. Women are seen as a symbol\nof a community\u2019s prestige and this is equally true of the Dalit community. Therefore, an\noutsider violating the honour of their women signals the powerlessness of the Dalits to\nprotect their womenfolk. And there are people who will not tolerate any assertion by Dalit\nwomen and are ready to suppress them and/or their voice at all costs31.\nIncidentally, this phenomenon also poses a major challenge for the empowerment of Dalit\nwomen, who are not able to speak out against the atrocities committed against them. A\nrecent three-year study of 500 Dalit women\u2019s experiences of violence across four Indian\nstates revealed that the majority of Dalit women faced one or more incidents of verbal\nabuse (62.4%), physical assault (54.8%), sexual harassment and assault (46.8%), domestic\nviolence (43.0%) and rape (23.2%)32\nApart from being forced into the most demeaning jobs, Dalit women are extremely\nvulnerable to sexual exploitation and are often victims of trafficking and forced sexual\nlabour. In India, some Dalit women are especially targeted for the harmful practices of\nthe devadasi and jogini systems of forced prostitution33.\nA recent study conducted has cited twelve major forms of violence against Dalit women,\nnine being violence in the general community \u2013 physical assault, verbal abuse, sexual\nharassment and assault, rape, sexual exploitation, forced prostitution, kidnapping and\nabduction, forced incarceration and medical negligence \u2013 and three being violence in the\nfamily \u2013 female foeticide and infanticide, child sexual abuse and domestic violence from\nnatal and marital family members.\nWhen considering discrimination and violence against Dalit women, sanctioned impunity\non behalf of the offenders is a key problem. Police personnel often neglect or deny the\nDalit women of their right to seek legal and judicial aid. Women tell of police officers\nrefusing to intervene or to even take their statements. In many cases, the judiciary fails to\n30 The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) formed on 11th March 1986, is an Indian Government\nagency responsible for collecting and analysing crime data as defined by the Indian Penal Code\n312013.

In 2006 in India, the\nofficial conviction rate for Dalit atrocity cases was just 5.3%.34(IDSN Briefing paper) Access\nto justice: P. Ashalatha in her study states that the impunity enjoyed by both dominant\ncaste community and the state officials continues largely due to the insensitiveness and\nthe continuous failure of the criminal justice administrative system. This is clearly\nillustrated in a recent national study of violence against Dalit women based on 500 cases35:\n\u2022 In 40.4 per cent of the cases, the women did not even attempt to obtain justice\n\u2022 In 26.6 per cent of the cases, the victims were prevented to file cases\n\u2022 In 1.6 per cent of the cases, the women were able to obtain informal justice\n\u2022 In 17.5 per cent of incidents, the violence reached the notice of the police, but cases\nwere left unaddressed\n\u2022 Only in 13.9 per cent of cases was appropriate police or judicial action taken.\n\u2022 A mere 3.6 per cent of cases have ever reached the courts while only 3 of the cases\n(less than one per cent) have ended in conviction. (Cited - Manorama, 2006)\nThe injustices and atrocities are made worse by the impunity enjoyed by the dominant\ncaste and state officials. But perhaps what is most disturbing is that Dalits themselves are\nnot aware that they are being abused or exploited, as such behaviour is considered to be\nthe norm and accepted as necessary even to live in society. For example, Dalits might not\nprotest at being called by their caste names, as this is the accepted mode of address by all\nsections of the community. A child made to sit at the back of the classroom or being asked\nto sweep the classroom is not considered discriminated against or exploited by either\nupper or lower castes.\nAccording to the Crime Statistics brought out by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government\nof India, the rate of crime committed against the SCs at all-India level is in the order of\nabout twenty five to thirty thousand per year. It shows an increasing trend over the years.\nDuring 1992 total crime against SCs was 24922 which increased to 33719 during 2011.

During the year1992, 849 were became the soft target of \u2018rape\u2019 which\nhas increased to 1557 during 2011 which is estimated to be growing at the rate of 3.82\npercent per annum. Besides, there are thousands of cases unreported and hence not\nfactored in the official statistics of the government. Therefore the reality is always\ndifferent. Besides, the violence and atrocities committed against the SC women are\nneither properly classified nor recorded through a scientifically data management system.\nSource: National Crime Record Bureau\n82 | Page\n948\n897\n299\n378\n949 7301 329 0001\n6131\n3801\n1331\n9801\n7511\n2711\n7121 9431\n7541\n6431 9431\n7551\n1800\n1600\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\nsesac\nepar\nfo\nrebmuN\n2991 3991 4991 5991 6991 7991 8991 9991 0002 1002 2002 3002 4002 5002 6002 7002 8002 9002 0102 1102\nCrime against Scheduled Castes Women (Rape) in India\nYears\nANNEXURE \u2013 I (CASE STUDIES)\nCASE STUDIES\nJharkhand\nCase 1 :\nName \u2013 Babuni Kisku, Husband\u2019s name \u2013 Umak Kisku, Village \u2013 Kolha, Gram Panchayat \u2013\nBandana Pahadi, District \u2013 Dumka, Jharkhand.\nThe prevalence and practice of witch-hunting or witchcraft in rural Jharkhand can be\ntraced to the pre-independence period. However, after independence, despite various\nprotective measures in action to punish the perpetrators, today also majority of rural Dalit\nand Adivasi women are subjected to such heinous form of violence, as is the case of\nBabuni Kisku, a Majhi. Babuni Kisku resides in the village Kolha of Dumka district,\nJharkhand with his husband, Umak Kisku. Kolha village comes under Bandana Pahadi gram\npanchayat. It was reported that 10 years before when Babuni Kisku was pregnant, she\nunderwent severe health problems. Her husband, Umak Kisku, consulted the doctor who\nadvised her some medications. However, the medicines could not recover her illness. So,\nafter failing from various sources of treatment, Umak Kisku decided to consult the\ntraditional healer, locally known as tantric baba, of the nearby village karanpura,. The\ntantrik baba visited her house, performed some rituals and chanted mantras. After which,\nhe gave a list of things to be bought for the next day\u2019s ritual puja and assured Umak Kisku\nto disclose the name of the witch responsible for his wife\u2019s illness. However, on his way\nback home, he was threatened by some Dalit women not to revisit the village as they\nknew that he would impose the belief of witches in the mind of the villagers. But, due to\nmale hegemony and fulfilment of personal wishes, he again visited Babuni Kisku\u2019s place\nthe next day and performed the puja till evening, after which he insisted to stay\novernight. He had dinner and consumed excess alcoholic drink bought by Umak Kisku for\nthe puja which resulted in his death. Thus, although, being from the same caste, he\nbelieved in the presence of witches and also forced the villagers to belief that such a\npractice is prevalent in the village, for which the women are subjected to harassment,\ndiscrimination and violence.\nCase 2 :\nName \u2013 Sakina Biwi, Husband\u2019s name \u2013 Badurrudin Ansari, Village \u2013 Lakhanpur, Gram\nPanchayat \u2013 Kadma Pahadi, District \u2013 Dumka, Jharkhand.\nThe conviction of witches and witchcraft is widely found among all communities of rural\nIndia such as Dalits, Adivasis, Muslims, etc. The case of Sakina Biwi of Lakhanpur village of\nDumka district, Jharkhand is one such instance. Sakina Biwi, 40 years, is residing in Muslim\ntola of Lakhanpur village with her husband, Badurrudin Ansari and four sons. They are\nmainly engaged as daily wage labours. Their socio-economic and educational status is very\npoor and backward. However, their suffering multiplied 9-10 years back, when Sakina biwi\nwas held responsible for the death of a boy from Muslim tola, since she was regarded as a\nwitch. It so happened that the boy was suffering from some ailment which gradually\naggravated, his body turned yellowish and finally he died. This bought a change in the\n83 | Page\nmindset of the villagers and they accused Sakina biwi for his death. The boy\u2019s family\nmembers and the villagers regard her as a witch who casts spells and evil deeds. She and\nher family were subjected to abusive language, harsh treatment and even beaten badly.\nMoreover, Sakina biwi was forced to consume human excreta and urine. Importantly, they\nfaced the humiliation and discrimination by their own muslim community. Thus, there\nexists a class-based discrimination with the caste group. Even the socially excluded Dalits\nand Adivasis residing in the village did not come to their rescue. Moreover, her husband\u2019s\nand sons\u2019 plea and complain to the police was in vain. Although, the matter was resolved\ninternally by the villagers, but today also she is looked upon as a witch.\nCase 3 :\nName \u2013 Kulsun Biwi, Husband\u2019s name \u2013 Niyamat Ansari, Village \u2013 Lakhanpur, Gram\nPanchayat \u2013 Kadma Pahadi, District \u2013 Dumka, Jharkhand.\nAnother instance of a Muslim woman, named Kulsun biwi is also an evidence of existence\nof class-based discrimination and deprivation with the caste group as regards to witches\nand witch-hunting. Kulsun biwi, 48 years old, is residing in Muslim tola of Lakhanpur\nvillage with her husband Niyamat Ansari and 3 sons. They are also mainly engaged as daily\nwage labours and are extremely backward. While narrating the incidence, Kulsun biwi\nstated that 10 years before, there was a girl named Sakila biwi in Muslim tola, who fell in\nlove with her neighbour\u2019s relative named, Salam Ansari. After some days, the boy went\nback and Sakila biwi suffered from mental disability and illness. Her family members, then\nstarted blaming Kulsun biwi for their daughters\u2019 deteriorating health condition. Similarly,\nthe villagers regard her as a witch. She and her family were subjected to abusive\nlanguage, harsh treatment and even beaten badly. Moreover, she was also forced to\nconsume human excreta and urine. They faced the humiliation and accusation by their\nown muslim community. Even the socially excluded Dalits and Adivasis residing in the\nvillage did not come to their rescue. Moreover, her husband\u2019s and sons\u2019 plea and complain\nto the police was in vain. Although, the matter was resolved internally by the villagers,\nbut today also she is looked upon as a witch.\nCase- 4 :\nFOCUS GROUP DISCUSSION\nIn FGD 1: Village \u2013 Lakhanpur, Panchayat - Kadma, Block \u2013 Kathikund, District \u2013 Dumka,\nJharkhand\nOn 3rd April, 2014, a focus group discussion was conducted by anganwadi sevika Ms.\nNachan Murmu in lakhanpur village of Kadma panchayat of Kathikund block, Dumka.\nAround 30 Dalit women participated in the meeting. The women stated that they strongly\nbelieve witches, witch practices and Ojhas. They added, a patient or a alleged victim\nbecomes mentally strong by the treatment of the ojha which helps in recovering faster.\nHowever, a social worker, Abram Murmu was also present in the discussion. He stated that\nthere is no such thing as witch, dian, chudial, black magic, sorcery, etc. The peoples\u2019\nfaith and believe in all these things are superstitious, illogical and baseless. In fact, all the\nwomen in the village are accused witch and practicing witchcraft. They are addressed as\ndian, chudial, etc. while engaging in any conflict.\n84 | Page\nThe ward member, Mr. Narain Marandi, agrees to the presence of the practice of\nwitchcraft & sorcery. He cited examples such as, if a person is bitten by a snake, then\nhe/she is recovered through sorcery, magic charms, offerings, etc. performed by the ojha.\nMoreover, if somebody is suffering from any ailment in the village, then the ojha treats\nhim/her through his pujas and offerings or ties the amulet and he/she gets recovered. If a\nperson is mentally disturbed and could not control his/her mind, then the ojha\u2019s\ntreatment cures him/her. From all these examples, it indicates that there is some\nsupernatural power in the practice of sorcery and black magic. As regards to accusation of\nwitch to a woman, he opined that a living woman cannot be considered a witch. Witch or\ndian or chudial are basically spirits who are invisible and evaded through charms and\npujas.\nA teacher, Likhani Tundu was also present in the discussion. He also said that there is no\nsuch thing as witch and witch practice. These are superstitions arising due to illiteracy,\nunemployment, poverty, inequality, etc. Lack of knowledge and education amongst the\nOjhas are the key factors which results in their wrong diagnosis and treatment. Hence, the\npatient\u2019s ailment aggravates or he/she dies resulting in suspicion in the minds of the\nfamily members. They get influenced by the ojha, who performs pujas and offerings and\nidentifies the culprit to be a witch. The villagers who are educated enough to understand\nthe importance of medical doctor, are in a better off position. However, some of the\npeople consult both the medical doctor as well as local doctor (ojha). And, even if the\npatient gets recovered by the doctor\u2019s treatment, they give credit to the ojha. Likewise,\nanother teacher, Luisa Soran present in the discussion was also of the opinion that the\nsuperstition of witch and witch practices are illogical. In some villages, the health care\nfacilities and services are inadequate. Hence, the uneducated and unawared villagers\ncould not know the exact cause and extent of the disease which mislead them to believe\nin the practice of witchcraft. As a result, they suffer more day by day due to physical and\nmental pressure and do not get recovered. But, if consulted a doctor and gets recovered,\nthen, the mental pressure and blockness lessens.\nMoreover, a dealer, named Mohammad Shamshad Ansari present in the meeting, asserts\nthat sometimes one should believe in the practice of witchcraft which has supernatural\npower to heal patients. For example, if a child cries constantly without stopping, then the\nvillagers believe that he/she is possessed by an evil spirit. As soon as the ojha performs\ncharms and pujas, the child stops crying.\nThus, based on the instances of witch practices by different people in the meeting, it can\nbe inferred that some regard it as superstition while others think that it exists and has\nsome supernatural powers to heal patients. But, as regards to accusation of witch, the\nwomen were silent. It seems, they were afraid of disclosing the fact as they might also\nhave to suffer the same discrimination and exploitation as the victim.\nCase 5 :\nName - Mary Chauda (Murbhu), Village \u2013 Puradi, Block \u2013 Churchu, District \u2013 Hazaribagh,\nJharkhand.\nIn Jharkhand, the accusation and subsequent violence against socially excluded SC/ST\nwomen as witches and witch practices has been increasing. The women are accused of\nwitches and persecuted in various severe forms. This has raised many questions such as,\nwho are these women? what is their socio-economic background? what factors are\nresponsible for their accusing as witches? etc. Thus, in order to get the answers to these\nquestions, the present study explored the existence and extent of witch hunting in Puradi\n85 | Page\nvillage of Churchu block of Hazaribagh district, Jharkhand. The village is about 11 kms\nfrom block churchu. The village has a private school and a dispensary. It was evident that\nthe SC/ST households were scattered around the village. In order to know the extent of\nthe practice of witch hunting in the village, various cases of SC/ST women were gathered.\nOne such instance is of Mary Chauda (Murbhu), aged 50-55 years. Mary got married at the\nage of 18 years. She has a son who is residing separately with his family. She and her\nhusband are engaged in daily wage labour works to sustain their livelihood. Mary\u2018s misery\nstarted at a very young age, after the death of her parents and four siblings. Her father\u2019s\npaternal property was sold by her uncle who ill-treated her and forced her to depend on\nthe villagers and relatives for her upbringing. Moreover, some years back, Mary was\naccused as a witch by her neighbour Namita Surain after her husband\u2019s death. However, it\nwas found that Mary\u2019s husband was having relation with Namita Surain. On complaining,\nMary was brutally harassed and beaten by her husband. In due course, her husband went\nto town for work and she was left alone in her house amid severe health and financial\nproblems. With great difficulty, she works two days a week through MNREGA and if needed\ntakes loan from SHGs to sustain her livelihood. Thus, frustrated on being accused as a\nwitch in the village and leading a very miserable life, Mary seeks justice and help from\nvarious sources, but in vain.\nCase 6 :\nName \u2013 Badki Mosamat (widow), Age \u2013 60 years, Tribe \u2013 Santhal, Husband\u2019s name \u2013 Late\nBaburam Tundu, Village \u2013 Purnadi, Block \u2013 Churchu, District \u2013 Hazaribagh, Jharkhand.\nThis is an instance of a illiterate widow, Badki Mosamat, aged 60 years. She belongs to\nsanthal tribe and resides with her four sons in hazaribagh district, Jharkhand. All her sons\nare married and have children. Her husband, Baburam Tundu passed away 18 years back.\nUnfortunately, her own elder son was responsible for her suffering and agony. It so\nhappened that once suddenly her elder son\u2019s daughter suffered from some ailments and\ncould not be recovered. Having ultimate faith on the Ojhas, her elder son consulted an\nojha who identified Badki as witch and practicing witch craft on his daughter. On getting a\nbaseless confirmation from the ojha, he abused and humiliated her mother. He accused\nher witch, blamed her for his daughter\u2019 illness and finally, drove her from his house.\nBadki, then stay with his younger son. However, after some days, the elder son\u2019s cattle\ndied. He again went to the ojha who reassured that his mother is a witch and all these\nmisfortunes are happening because of her casting evil spells and black magic. He\nimmediately went to his younger brother\u2019s house to fight with his mother, but her younger\ndaughter-in-law came to her rescue. Moreover, one day, a young girl of the village died on\nthe day of her wedding. An angry mob of villagers attached Badki and her younger son and\nbrutally tortured them. However, the case was discussed in the panchayat and then some\npeople went to seek advice from the bhagat (knowledgeable person) who told them that\nthe main culprit is her elder daughter-in-law\u2019s mother. But, instead of believing the\nbhagat, the villagers believed the ojha and once again humiliated and tortured her. They\nbelieve that the cause of all deaths and illness in the village is because of evil spells and\nblack magic practiced by Badki. They regard her witch and threaten to banish from the\nvillage or lynch her. To this, her younger son advised her to shift to some other place, so\nthat she can be saved from the malicious intentions of the villagers and her elder son.\nBadki shifted to her native village purnadi in church block of hazaribagh district and\nresiding with her widow sister-in-law. But, a helpless and fearless widow Badki, without\nhaving any means of financial & personal support tried to end her life. Fortunately, she\nwas saved, motivated and convinced by the women of a self-help group of the village.\nToday, the self-help group is encouraging and helping badki mosamat to overcome the\nsufferings and lead a very contented life.\n86 | Page\nCase 7 :\nName \u2013 Sangeeta Devi (widow), Age \u2013 30 years, Caste \u2013 Paswan (SC), Husband\u2019s name \u2013\nLate Gopi Singh, Native Village \u2013 Mohalabi Nagina bazar, Dhanbad, Jharkhand,\nHusband\u2019s place \u2013 Hazaribagh, Jharkhand.\nA young widow of 30 years, sangeeta Devi was born in mohalabi nagina bazaar of Dhanbad\ndistrict, Jharkhand. She was married at the age of 24 years to rajrani\u2019s son gopi singh of\nhazaribagh district, Jharkhand. After one year of marriage, she was blessed with a son.\nGopi singh was a cancer patient. He and his parents mislead sangeeta\u2019s family for\nmarriage. Sangeeta was not aware of his illness till marriage. Gopi had a tea stall in the\nvillage. He used to handover all his earnings to his mother and she used to provide him the\nharmful drugs and drinks he was addicted to. Despite being advised by the doctor to stop\nthe consuming of drugs and drinks, he continued it. This aggravated his condition.\nMoreover, his family discontinued the treatment of the doctor and consulted the ojha.\nBut, as destined, he passed away after some years. After 10 days of his death, the family\nmembers started considering Sangeeta a witch and she was held responsible for the death\nof his husband. She was cursed, abused, tormented and discriminated severely. Likewise,\nshe was given the leftover foods to eat and sometimes no food at all. Inadequate food,\nbrutal & intolerable torture, humiliation, burden of work, curse of witch, etc. degraded\nher health. One day, while going to fetch water from the well, she covertly called up her\nfather from her neighbour\u2019s phone and told him all about her sufferings. She asked him to\ncome and take her away. On arriving in his daughter\u2019s house, he saw that she is been\npulled by her hairs and beaten badly by in-laws. However, he resisted and saved her.\nSangeeta was one and half months pregnant at that time. There were some arguments\nbetween the two parties but finally sangeeta returned to her native place, dhanbad. While\nreturning her in-laws grabbed their grandchild from her and kept with them. She\nregistered the case in the police station in dhanbad. But, the police in dhanbad demanded\nRs. 5000 for the logistics and other arrangements to hazaribagh. On receiving Rs 5000 from\nsangeeta, two lady police officers visited her in-laws and returned back without much\neffort. They neither get her son back nor did they take any action against them. The\npolice could not do anything to bring back her son. This totally changed her life and she\nremained depressed, silent and ailed. But, then, a ray of hope shined on her and she gave\nbirth to a daughter. She is now 7 months old but, its been one and half years sangeeta is\naway from her son. Due to her acute financial condition, she even could not fight in the\ncourt for her son. Thus, now, her only inspiration in life is her daughter about which her\nin-laws are not aware. They would have otherwise, definitely tried to kill her and also\ntake her away from her life.\nCase 8 :\nName \u2013 Mamta Devi W/o Sh. Satish Ram R/o Village \u2013 Churchu, Post \u2013 Churchu, District \u2013\nHazaribagh, Jharkhand.\nPresent case is related to Mamta Devi who belongs to a poor family. Her husband is a daily\nwager.

Who charged a lot and also demanded goat, hen and alcohol. Even after\noffering huge money, goat, hen and alcohol her son was not coming out of his sickness.\nMamta also shared that one day quarrel took place between her and her neighbour who\nabused Mamta and also blamed her for illness of her (neighbour) son because that lady\n87 | Page\nbelieved that Mamta is witch-hunter. Mamta took this case to Panchayat. Panchayat hold\nthat that Mamta\u2019s neighbour is guilty of abusing her and calling witch. At that time\nNeelam Basera, worker of Jharkhand Mahila Utthan Sanstha came in contact with Mamta\nand she did counselling of Mamta. Now Mamta had come out of all tantra-mantra and\njhad-phoonk.\nCase 9 :\nName \u2013 Salo Murmu, 65 years W/o Late Sh.

Salo Murmu\u2019s husband was suffering from\nMirgi. During Mirgi feasts Bonifus Besra behaved like a mad person. The victim and other\nneighbours took him to some Ojha/tantric. But victim\u2019s husband could not recover from\ndisease and in frustration, one day he jumped into a well and died. After his demise\nrelatives and neighbours started calling her a witch. They believed that she had eaten her\nhusband.\nAfter few days victim\u2019s elder daughter-in-law had abdominal pain and she died in the lack\nof proper treatment. Again, people got chance to blame Salo Murmu for the sudden\ndemise of her daughter-in-law. Relatives and other people also abused her a lot and took\nher to Ojhas and tantrics who said there was evil spirit in the house and these killings\nwould continue if they would not donate chicken, mutton and alcohol to tantrics. Salo\nMurmu and her relatives donated chicken, mutton and alcohol for a long period without\nfail. After one year tantric told the victim\u2019s in-laws that Salo Murmu\u2019s parents sent a ghost\nwith her at the time of her marriage and that ghost killed two people in house. After\nlistening this news she tried to kill herself but fortunately her son saved her life.\nAt present her son is working as cook in a Christian hostel. She is living with her family\nhappily.

In the month of June\u2019 2013 her sister-in-\nlaw\u2019s (jethani) daughter-in-law conceived but unfortunately daughter-in-law could not\ncarry the child due to weakness and miscarriage took place. Taitri Devi\u2019s jethani blamed\nher for miscarriage and abused her a lot by saying that Taitri Devi is a witch. Whenever\nthere is any fight at home Taitri Devi is blamed for it. This is another case of the false\nattribution and ignorance breeding undue damage to the health of women by significant\nrelatives.\nCASE NO. 11 :\nName \u2013 Merry Murmu W/o Sanju Nandi R/o Village \u2013 Dumar, Post \u2013 Churchu, District \u2013\nHazaribagh, Jharkhand.\n88 | Page\nMerry Murmu, aged 35, belongs to a lower middle class family.

Having ten\nchildren and the children of children . The accusation came after the death of her\nhusband and then her son. When the wife of her son called Ojha then Ojha said that\nChandani Murmu is afflicted with Bhoot. It was only toward the last of her lifetime that\nshe got this accusation. People started calling her a dayan after the death of her husband\nand son. This happened after her daughter in law brought in Ojha who received chicken,\ngoat, pig, alchohal, clothes. Since ,Ojha has nothing else to say for the illness related\ndeath and since he had to establish his importance ,he had to find a person who could be\nidentified as a witch. She found Chandani Murmu an easy. Sons of Chandani Murmu\nsupported her. But , she was harassed with the accusation and suffered. She was beaten\nfor being a Dayan when the wife of one of his son passed away. Here, again ,we have a\npattern of false attribution for illnesses that become responsible for death. Some get\nscared for some reasons and then there is no psychological counselling. People have been\naway from the hospitals. Illnesses have not be diagnosed. India needs to get mental health\nand health support delivered across the villages. Clinical Psychologists need to be\nappointed in each block in order to ensure that people are counselled for understanding\nthe reasons of death and illness which appear to be letting people go to consult Ojhas who\n90 | Page\ncomes up with the name of someone as the person whose evil magic needs to be taken\ncare off. Nothing happens as a result of Ojha\u2019s incantation but with more deaths , the\nperson identified as Dayan is persecuted again and again.\nCase 17 :\nIn INDEPTH INTERVIEWS 1 :\nName- Mr. Horil Sharma, Churchu, Hazaribagh, Social Worker\nHe informed that he has been working against corruption that is most prevalent in his\nworking area. Informing about his work for raising awareness on women\u2019s right ,he said\nthat he did not work against prevention of violence against generated through the\naccusation of being a witch. He believed that Ojhas are responsible for generating ideas\non witchcraft. Rohinia and Gondwar village were the locations where he reported women\nhad been beaten.\nCase 18 :\nIn INT 2 : Name \u2013 Mr. Sanjay Basu Mallick, Renowned Writer, Ranchi,Jharkhand.\nThe study conducted the interview of most renowned writer, Mr. Sanjay Basu Mallick in\nregard to witch and witchcraft. Mr. Basu was born in West Bengal. He is the only\npampered son of his parents. His father was a businessman and mother, housewife. From a\nvery young age of 17 years, he became the joint secretary of his college. Subsequently, he\nleft his home and stayed with the Dalits and Adivasis for rendering his myriad service to\nthem. He worked dedicatedly for the wellbeing and development of these socially\nexcluded communities. Through various protests and andolans, he fought for their rights\nand justice. He even had to go to jail in the struggle for justice alongwith 300 Dalits and\nAdivasis. In this process, he and his associates adapted the language and culture of the\nAdivasis and Dalits. They were in the jail for nearly 5 years, due to which his studies\ndiscontinued and subsequently, he moved to Ranchi. In Ranchi, he started protest against\nwitch hunting and for preservation of forests and married to a girl who was also involved\nin the countless service of the poor and excluded. He did his M.A. in Adivasis language,\nMungri and then, after 16 years in 1997, he got admission in Jawaharlal Nehru University\nfor pursuing his Ph.D. studies.\nMr. Basu asserted that he came to know many things about the cultures and traditions of\nthe Adivasis and Dalits while working with them. He added, people have a firm belief in\nwitch and witch practices. They think that both men and women are possessed with evil\nspirit and are designated as witch. They have supernatural power which can harm\nanybody. One of his friend, Sanjay said that although he has not seen a witch but has\nheard about it. On a full moon night, the witch comes near the village or the bank of the\nriver and start dancing nakedly. On enquiring why nakedly, Sanjay replied that people\nreveal that while dancing nakedly a witch gets the supernatural power to harm the people\nor children. Furthermore, a witch is discriminated and exploited severely, by forcing them\nto consume human wastes or drink urine or physically assault them (beat) or at the least\nabuse and drag them by their hairs.\nThus, in order to have in-depth knowledge about the extent and reason of witch\naccusation and persecution, he did his Ph.D. in this topic. In this regard, while doing his\nPh.D., he consulted Dr. Devnathan and his wife Govinda in order to get some information\nabout it. From the discussion, he inferred that witch hunting is basically a religious and\ntraditional superstition, due to which women are severely exploited, persecuted and\n91 | Page\ndiscriminated. Who am I?, From where have I come and where will I go?, etc. are the\nquestions that have generated ideas and faiths and there are some who are ready to\naccept the occult ideas without learning on the answers without having any superstition\nthat results in exploitation of women and usurpation of their rights to live with dignity.\nBlack magic and sorcery are the factors which nurture superstition. Then, he explored the\ncause of black magic and sorcery. He found that people believe that every living being is\nborn out of yoni (vulva/womb or source of life) and after death he merges in the five\nelements of earth. Hence, a yoni is powerful and needs to be worshipped. There are many\nplaces where yonis are worshipped such as in Jagannath temple, Puri, Kamakhya temple,\nNepal, etc. but they are covered with clothes and sindoor.\nMoreover, traditionally, women have discovered many things which gives them inner\nstrength and power, such as doing agriculture by burning fields and forests, preparing\ntraditional medicines by plants & herbs in natural way, etc. They were also very strong\nand considerate in checking the quality of burnt foods to be given to their children by\nconsuming the burnt seeds and fruits first. In this process, they also discovered the\ntraditional medicines from the herbs and plants by witnessing recovery in minor ailments.\nMoreover, they discovered fire by striking two stones with each other. All these things\nmade them the owner which developed envy in the minds of men. Hence, in order to have\ncontrol over their strength and power, the men started exploiting and discriminating\nwomen.\nHe further stated that in other communities the discrimination and exploitation against\nwomen is limited to abusive language. But, in Dalit community, women have failed &\nsurrendered towards men\u2019s harassment and violence on them. They are like non-living\nmaterials for their husbands, who think they can torture and exploit their women in any\nways. Mr. Basu is of the opinion that a society where a woman is subordinated and\nexploited cannot develop. Citing examples, he cited the instance of Holika, Tadaka and\nSita. This is the reason why Dalit and Adivasi communities are still backward and\nunderdeveloped where women are not being honoured . A woman is a symbol of love and\naffection. According to him, violence and atrocities is happening due to the existence\npatriarchal system of society where men consider women as their slaves . Some decades\nago, thousands of women were burnt alive because they were having the knowledge of\nmedicinal plants and herbs. Earlier, there were no male doctors in the society, the\nfemales were treating the patients. But, now, everything has changed. The women are\ndeprived of their right to treat patients, build houses, etc. since, the owner of the house\nis a male. This resulted in various struggles and protests but in vain. The practice of witch\nand witch hunting is prevalent mostly in the patriarchal system of society where the men\ndominate women and where modern health delivery system has not reached creating\nspace for the quacks and Ojhas who are being reached.\nNow, the question is what is a witch? It might be a conspiracy by men to subordinate or\nweaken women who are more powerful and have control over many things. They accuse\nthem of being a witch and humiliate them in front of the villagers. They motivate and\nconvince the villagers against the alleged woman. Now, he turned the discussion towards\nthe issue of sexual assault, which is also one of the most important factors of witch\naccusation. What is the main reason for all the rape and sexual assault cases? Men are\nattracted towards women only because of sexual pleasure which weakens them. According\nto Basu, a man cannot remain satisfied by a single woman even though there is no concern\nwhere women are feeling satisfied or not. He needs many women to satisfy his sexual\nmotive. So, in order to put an end to the growing cases of rape, a woman needs to satisfy\nman. It is because of this that poly-marriages prevail in our society. If a woman denies\n92 | Page\nsatisfying the sexual drive of a man, then she is accused a witch and harassed severely.\nThe extent of exploitation is such that, the police also does not help the victim who is\nbeing accused a witch and then raped, assuming it a social and religious matter. Thus, the\nexploitation and discrimination against women, particularly Dalit women are immense.\nThe media has also pointed out many such cases. On one hand, they are illiterate and on\nthe other, they do not get exposure in the media.\nThe various case studies illustrated reveals that the practice of witchcraft prevails in\ndifferent districts of Jharkhand. Many innocent women are being persecuted, tortured and\neven lynched in Jharkhand. Thus, in order to have detailed understanding of the\ndimensions, existence and extent of the witch phenomenon in the districts of Jharkhand,\nindepth interviews of doctors, ward member, sarpanch, police authorities, political and\nsocial leaders and NGO leaders were conducted which is discussed in the subsequent\nsection.\nCase 19 :\nName \u2013 Mala Devi, Husband\u2019s name \u2013 Balram Verma, Village \u2013 Simra, District \u2013 Deogarh,\nJharkhand.\nThe life of Dalit and Adivasi women of Deogarh district, Jharkhand is also centred on the\naccusation and discrimination of witches and witch practices. There have been evidences\nof many such instances. However, the case of Mala Devi & Chunni Devi is one such\ninstance. Mala Devi lives in Simra village with her husband and two young daughters. It\nwas reported that she is accused and addressed as a witch in the village. The villagers\nheld her responsible for anybody\u2019s ill health or even death as they perceive that she\npractices witchcraft. She is often harshly abused or beaten badly. The villagers harass her\nand her family by excluding and discriminating them in accessing the basic services in the\nvillage. They live a life of fear and anguish. It is because of this that her two young\ndaughters could not marry till now. Thus, she stated that although there have been laws\nand provisions to punish the perpetrators, but, today also, the rural women are facing the\nhardship of being witches. The Governments campaigns and programs are somehow failing\nto address the issue. She further stated that there is need to abolish this superstition from\nthe roots. For this, the women themselves have to come to the front and struggle for their\nrights, so that they can lead a life of honour and dignity.\nCase 20 :\nName \u2013 Quresha Biwi, Village \u2013 Simra, District \u2013 Deogarh, Jharkhand.\nOn 25th Feb, 2014, another instance of the practice of witch hunting was found in Simra\nvillage, Jharkhand. This is the case of Quresha biwi, an old aged woman. She is residing\nalone in Simra village. It was found that she is being accused as a witch and held\nresponsible for the death of a child by some of the villagers namely, Safik, Aadish Mia,\nHamidan biwi, Fahima Khatun and Asgul Mia. She was subjected to harassment,\ndiscrimination and violence and finally forced to drink human urine by her own community\npeople. However, she filed complaint against them in the police station. Thus, it is\nevident that there still exists discrimination within the caste or community group.\nCase 21 :\nName \u2013 Nunwati Devi, Village \u2013 Baghmari, District \u2013 Deogarh, Jharkhand.\n93 | Page\nThis is the case of Nunwati Devi of Baghmari village, Jharkhand. She is accused as a witch\nand practicing witchcraft by Gita Devi & her family of the same village. She was badly\nphysically tortured and forced to consume human urine. However, the case was registered\nin C.J.M court.\nCase 22 :\nName \u2013 Late Abba Mia (male), Age \u2013 70 years, Village \u2013 Bagadabera, Police station \u2013\nSarath, Post \u2013 Wamandiha, District \u2013 Deogarh, Jharkhand.\nIn many parts of Jharkhand, the victims of witchcraft allegations have not only been\nwomen from the marginalized, poor and ethnic communities but, there are also various\ninstances of accusation of witch on men. One such instance is of Abba Mia, aged 70 years\nof bagadabera village of deogarh district. In 2011, Abba Mia passed away due to violence\nand atrocity meted against him for practicing witchcraft. The village bagadabera comes\nunder Sarath police station and Wamandiha post office. It is dominated by Muslims\nexcepting 3 houses of Yadavs. It has a primary school named, Primary and Middle School,\nbagadabera. There are 3 wells and 2 handpumps in the village. A total of 77 households\nhave BPL card but they are not benefitted by Indira Awas Yojana. The village does not\nhave a community hall. The sarpanch, Ms. Pramila Devi, wife of Naresh Mandal resides in\nKhera village of Bagadabera panchayat. The head of the village is Suleiman Ansari, aged\n55 years. The anganwadi sevika\u2019s name is Ms. Rehana Khatun and her assistant Ms.\nTabassum Khatun. Abba Mia has four daughters and a son. The sons\u2019 name is Naim Ansari,\naged 30 years and his wife\u2019s name is kadbanu Biwi. Niam Ansari stated that their\nneighbour Kadir Mia, Nehru Biwi and some villagers accused Abba Mia of casting evil spells\nand black magic on their son who eventually died. They brutally tortured and beat him\nmercilessly to die. After his death, his family registered the case against them and finally\nthey were found guilty and put behind the bars. However, Abba Mia\u2019s family did not\nreceive any compensation from the government.\nCase 23 :\nName \u2013 Late Sabini Biwi, Age \u2013 62 years, Village \u2013 Patharghatiya, Police station \u2013\nPalojori, District \u2013 Deogarh, Jharkhand.\nThis is the case of a 62 year old Muslim woman Late Sabini Biwi. She was residing in\npatharghatiya village of Deogarh district, Jharkhand. The village consists of 150\nhouseholds. The village has one functional handpump. Majority of them belong to Muslim\ncommunity. The aaganwadi sevak, Shri Nageshwar Prasad Das resides in Madhupur village.\nSabini biwi\u2019s son, Islam Mia reported that his mother was considered a witch and\npracticing witchcraft on the villagers. The villagers had a belief that Sabini biwi was\nresponsible for anybody\u2019s death or illness in the village. So, she and her family were\ndiscriminated ruthlessly. Sabini biwi could not tolerate the curse of the baseless &\nsuperstitious practice of witchcraft and ultimately died in 2011. Islam Mia further stated\nthat, now also their family are humiliated and deprived of the basic facilities in the\nvillage. They are living a life of fear and apprehension. Majority of the villagers also\nregard Gulenur Biwi, her daughter-in-law, a witch (dian). They are discriminated in\naccessing the basic services or facilities provided by the Government. They even have not\nreceived the voter id card. He stated that the villagers also create problem in the market\nplace while selling mutton which is their primary occupation. However, the sarpanch was\nof the opinion that such a practice is mere superstition and efforts are being made to\nevade it. Moreover, in regard to the Government facilities, he said that the villagers, who\nhave not been benefitted, were assured to receive soon. Thus, it can be concluded that\n94 | Page\nwitch hunting is a superstitious practice that leads to the persecution and death of\nhundreds of widow women of poor, backward and ethnic communities.\nCase 24 :\nName \u2013 Nuneswari Devi, Age \u2013 62 years, W/O Late Jogeshwar Das, Village \u2013\nGarmuadiha, Police station \u2013 Kunda, Panchayat \u2013 Jharkhandi, Block \u2013 Mohanpur,\nDistrict \u2013 Deogarh, Jharkhand.\nAnother case of prevalence of witch hunting in Deogarh district in 2010 is of a 62 year old\nwidow, Nuneswari Devi residing in Garmuadiha village of Mohanpur block. The village\ngarmuadiha is at a distance of about 16 kms from deogarh district. The means of\ncommunication to the village is very poor. There are two handpumps, one of which is non-\nfunctional. There is a higher secondary school in the village consisting of total 174\nstudents. But, the attendance is very poor i.e. around 40 students per day. The village\nlacks employment opportunities and health facilities. Therefore, the villagers had to\ncommute 16 kms to deogarh for work opportunity and health facility. The village consists\nof a total of 300 households of which 70 percent belongs to Scheduled caste and 30\npercent belongs to other backward classes. The ward member name is Smt. Pinky Devi,\nwife of Mr. Arun Das. The sarpanch of the village is Shri Ramnarayan Mahato. Shri\nMaheswar Das, son of late Viru Das, reported that Nuneswari Devi practices witchcraft and\nblack magic on their family as well as the whole village. She is believed to have an alleged\npossession by an evil spirit giving her supernatural powers to alter the course of nature.\nShe does all kinds of pujas, prayers, and offerings and casts evil spells. However,\nNuneswari Devi states that Maheswar Das\u2019s allegation is baseless and illogical. Maheswar\nDas and some of his relatives address her witch and harass her terribly. They physically\nand mentally assault her brutally. However, the matter resolved after intervention of\npolice and court.\nCase 25 :\nName \u2013 Nanuwati Devi, Age \u2013 45 years, W/O Kailash Das, Village \u2013 Koriasa, District \u2013\nDeogarh, Jharkhand.\nThe present illustration is a clear evidence of interpersonal dispute or family dispute. The\ndispute is due to the possession of land, property and other valuable belongings. Nunuwati\nDevi, 45 years old woman is the second wife of Kailash Das. They reside in koriasa village\nof deogarh district, Jharkhand. The village consists of 200 households of various castes.\nKailash Das was working as a labourer in the railway department, now retired. Kailash Das\nhas two sons named Subhash Kumar and Nirmal kumar from his first wife. Subhash kumar\nworks as a photographer and Nirmal kumar works in the veterinary department. Due to\nfamily disputes, particularly, land and property, both the brothers are staying away from\ntheir father in Kanmankathi village. However, on the evening of 20th March 2011, the sons\nvisited her house and physically assaulted (beat) her. They snatched all her jewellery and\nforced her to consume human wastes. They alleged her being a witch and practicing\nwitchcraft on their mother who died. Thus, nanuwati lodged complaint against them but,\naction was not taken. Now, also they harass and threaten her due to which she is leading a\nlife of fear. On the other hand, Subhash, his wife and Nirmal opined that they are\ninnocent. They have never alleged her of practicing witchcraft. Instead, she has taken\nhold of all the property of their father and denied to share. Thus, the dispute is still going\non between them. The villagers tried to resolve the matter but in vain.\n95 | Page\nCase 26 and 27 :\nName \u2013 Rasimi (Age \u2013 14 years, Father\u2019s name \u2013 Sanjay Singh) and Rosni (Age \u2013 12\nyears, Father \u2013 Ramanuj Singh), Mohalla \u2013 Police line, Village \u2013 Dabar, Police station \u2013\nGisidiha, District \u2013 Deogarh, Jharkhand.\nIn deogarh district, there has been rise in the cases of witch accusation and persecution of\nthe young girls. One such instance is of Rasim and Rosni of police line of dabar village of\ndeogarh district. On the evening of 27th May 2013, these two minor girls were kidnapped\nand found murdered. Their dead body was recovered from a manhole. Such type of\ninstances is on a rise in deogarh district even though there are strict laws and regulations\nagainst it. The women and girls are subordinated and exploited by the patriarchal system\nof the society. They live a life of fear and apprehension. The Government should take\nextreme steps to protect the women and girls and make them independent. The\nperpetrators should be severely punished. Efforts should be made to create a matriarchal\nsystem of society rather than patriarchal society. As a result, women\u2019s strength, voices\nand importance can be understood. They can live a happy and feraless life. However, the\nincrease in the inhuman exploitation and violence meted out against the women and minor\ngirls, indicate the failure of the government\u2019s efforts in rendering them justice and\nequality in the society.\nCase 28 :\nBlock \u2013 Manikapur, District \u2013 Deoghar, Jharkhand.\nOn 24th July 2014, in manikapur block of Deogarh district, a S.T.F. Jawan, Pintu Sharma\nattempted to molest a minor girl of the nearby viilage. The villagers were outraged and\nstarted beating him brutally. On seeing this, the Deogarh authorities, deported Pintu\nSharma to headquarter. However, this raised their anger and they protested against it.\nThey asserted that if the culprit had been a common villager, then he would have been\npunished. But, since, Pintu sharma was a police jawan, he was not punished. This shows\nthe biasness of the authorities. The person responsible for the protection and safety of the\ngeneral public, is committing\nFigure 1 CADAM and RDMA leader Ms.Sumedha Bodh Interviewing Mala Devi\nthe crime which dissuades\nbelieve in them. The villagers\nfeel unsafe and unprotected. So, extreme steps should be taken against him. In fact, he\nshould be expelled from his service and imprisoned for attempting such a heinous crime.\nCase Number 29:\nMala Devi W/O Sh. Balram Sharma, 45 years, Caste-Koiri, Religion- Hindu, Village-\nMasnodi, Post- Simra, Police Station- Jasidih, District- Deogarh, Jharkhand.\nOn 27 September, 2014 Mala Devi was given human excreta to drink. Her daughter some\nyears ago had committed suicide. After two month, daughter of sister in law (gotni)\npassed away. She was accussed of being a witch after some said that Jagdamba baba\n96 | Page\nappeared on her sister in law and\nrevealed about this. Mala Devi\nand her husband went to the\npolice station after she was\nforced to drink human excreta,\nbut police did not register her\nFIR. Hovewer police reached the\nvillage and threatened that if\nthere is a repeat of the incidence\nthen all perpetrators would be in jail. Once this was in the news, RDMA activist Jyotiraj\nreached Masnodi village. She was asked not to visit the house of Mala Devi but when she\nreached with the police, they had no option. Police threatened again that none should be\ncalling her a witch. When inquired on the background of all this violence, Mala Devi said\nthat her daughter ten years ago committed suicide by jumping in a well. At that time, she\nwas not being able to get a good match for her daughter and home environment was also\nfull of dispute on land ownership and share. There was no proper match for her daughter.\nOnce a match came with a man who had two kids ,but villager spoke against her and her\ndaughter saying that she is witch and her daughter is also one. All this created deep pain\nand anguish in the mind of her daughter due to which she committed suicide. Now, she\nhas two more daughters who need to be married. Since the visit of RDMA, police has made\nseveral rounds of the village. None is calling her dayan, but then there is no guarantee\nthat villagers steeped in ignorance would not be speaking against her. This case shows how\nthe false accusation is being with zero sensitivity on the needs of Mala Devi and her\ndaughters. Ideally, villagers should have supported finding a good match, counselling the\ndaughter of Mala Devi on marrying and establishing a family rather than speaking against\nher. Much work for compassion , support and care is needed in villages where attitude for\ncare and concern for suffering is lacking\nCase Number 30 :\nName - Chunka Devi W/O Sh.

Villagers followed her and\nshe was accused of being a\nwitch. Villager asked her to go to\nMakhdoom Baba but she refused\nto go. Then villager took Panji\nDevi to Makdoom Baba who\ninformed that there are two\nwitches in her village. When\nvillagers came back they\nassaulted Chunka Devi but could\nFigure 2 Jyoti Raj and Sumedh both meeting Chunka Devi\n97 | Page\nnot do anything to Mala Devi. On 16 October, 2014, RDMA team consisting of Ms.Jyoti Raj,\nSumedha Bodh, Lawyer Phuleshwar Kumar Pandit and Annu Devi visited Chunki Devi to find\nout whether there was any issue between her and the villagers or between the relatives.\nShe denied the existence of any such thing. She went to the police station but police did\nnot take action. Then, she filed a complaint in the court, where people were called and\nan agreement was reached without any punishment to the perpetrators.\nCase Number 31:\nPancha Devi w/o Sh. Prakash Verma, 25 years, Caste- Koiri , Category \u2013 OBC, Religion-\nHindu, Village- Masnodi, Post- Simra, Police Station- Jasidih, District- Deogarh,\nJharkhand.\nThe case of Pancha Devi is related to Mala Devi which RDMA investigated to find out the\nreason of her going to the house of Mala\nDevi and telling her that she was a witch.\nPancha Devi informed that she did not know\nabout her going there but villager say that\nshe went to the house of Mala Devi calling\nher a dayan in the influence of Makhdoom\nBaba. On probing it was found that she used\nto have headache and burning sensation in\nchest for which she sought treatment.\nDoctor finally giving up at the government\nhospital suggested that she should be\nvisiting for prayer. This is the reason\nFigure 3 RDMA activist meting Pancha Devi sitting on the ground\nshe went to the Makdoom Baba where\nshe was gave the needful for asking\nlike Itr, chador and other one for Makhdoom baba and another for Jalali Baba whose\ngraves were there. Their family reported that since last one year she is not reporting any\nproblem. However, it can be inferred that there was some psychological problem for\nwhich she needed treatment. Faith healing appeared to have helped her. In a special\nmental state, she reached the house of Mala Devi about which she was not conscious. Such\ncases further show that psychiatric and psychological support is needed for people in the\nvillages where deep counselling and proper medications helps. Mala Devi and Chunka Devi\nbecame the victim of mental illness of Pancha Devi who not being conscious spoke things\nabout which she was not aware.\nCase Number 32 :\nSumitra Devi W/O Sh.

He is a\nward member of ward no 16. While interviewing, he stated that the poor, backward and\nminority women, especially widow are regarded as inferior and are subordinated due to\nthe patriachal system of society. The prevalence of witch hunting is usually found among\nthe lower castes and illiterate communities. These vulnerable sections of the society are\nusually identified as witches with an aim to denounce them from the community and take\ncontrol over their land, property etc. He further stated that this is the reason why mostly\nsingle women and widows become \u2018easy scapegoats\u2019 and are branded as witches to\ndeprive them of their property. The practice is mostly prevalent in rural areas than urban\nareas. While stressing on putting an end to such a superstitious practice, he affirmed that\nmany attempts have been made to end the practice through various protests and\ncampaigns even against the authorities and had also been fruitful. However, the media\nand newspaper also exaggerate such cases. One such case was of two brothers who had\ndisputes because of property, which later took the shape of witch allegation, but finally\nresolved\nCase 36 :\nIn INT 2 : Name \u2013 Shri Lalit Mohan Singh, Zila Samaj Kalyan Kendriya, Deogarh,\nJharkhand.\nShri Lalit Mohan Singh is a representative of Zila Samaj Kalyan Kendriya. While discussing\non the issues of witchcraft and witch hunting, he revealed that the there has been no\nsupport, cooperation or efforts of the organization in evading the practice. He is of the\n100 | Page\nopinion that the self help groups, social & political organizations as well as Government\nplay an important role in impeding the practice and seeking justice for the vulnerable\ncommunities. Witch hunting is a superstitious and unpleasant practice in society. It results\nin socio-economic disempowerment of marginalized women. Hence, the promotion of\nscientific temper becomes as important as ensuring the empowerment of fringe\ncommunities. Moreover, awareness campaigns are organized in large-scale through\nposters, pamphlets, banners, etc. The self help groups and other organizations also\nconduct rallies, protests, andolans, seminars, etc in the market place. Even, the\nGovernment have allocated a budget of Rs. 55,000 for the issue. At the panchayat level,\nthe voices of the common people and their participation are also considered an important\nfactor for culminating the practice. Thus, the Zila Samaj Kalyan Kendriya is making every\npossible effort and providing enormous support to other non-governmental organizations\nto impede the practice.\nCase 37 :\nIn INT 3 : Name \u2013 Shri Subodh Prasad, Police Officer, Deogarh, Jharkhand.\nThe study also involved interviewing the police authority on the concerns of witch hunting.\nShri Subodh Prasad is a police officer in deogarh district, Jharkhand. He revealed some of\nthe cases of witch hunting which he encountered in his service period. The first case is of\nSarai Kela where an old witch doctor (Ojha) was accused of practicing black magic and\nsorcery on a child who eventually fell ill. However, the main cause of child\u2019s illness was\ndog bite. But, the family blamed the ojha and wasted no time in attacking him. Another\ncase is of Lohardaga where an old aged minority woman was alleged a witch by the\npradhan of the village and levied a hefty fine of Rs. 10,000. However, the police\nintervened and resolved the case. There was also a case of witch hunting in Dumka,\nwhere five culprits were arrested due to witch allegation. Such type of practice is mostly\nprevalent among the Scheduled caste, Scheduled tribe, Minority and Other backward\nclasses and particularly the widow women. He is also of the opinion that it commences\ndue to family disputes in land or property. Moreover, in some instances, the victims are\nusually restrained from seeking help from the police, and on the other, mislead the police.\nThere is hardly any prevalence among the upper class or middle class communities. He\nadded that it is a very serious concern and needs to be addressed through awareness\ncampaigns and support from media. Media can play an important role in awaking and\nconvincing the people. Witch hunting is an age old social and traditional superstitious\nbelief that leads to the persecution and death of innocent women. Hence, efforts should\nbe made to protect the vulnerable women. On affirming his support for such incidents, he\nstated that he has and would make attempts to culminate the practice. There should be\nlarge-scale meetings and associations of women in different villages to awake them\nagainst the practice. People should be educated and empowered to understand the evil\neffects of the practice. Lastly, he stated that the role of police should be strong enough to\nimpact and change the mindset of the villagers.\nInterview with the representatives of NGOs as per the checklist\nCase 38 :\nIn Interview number 4 : Mr.Kuldip Ravidas, Dr.B.R.Ambedkar Library, Doeghar ,\nJharkhand, Mobile Number 9430182225\nMr.Kuldip Ravidas narrated that since his childhood he has been fighting against social\nevils. He recounted his experience of communicating against undue respect to people\n101 | Page\nfrom Bhumihar caste who used to ensure that a Dalit /SC person does not sit on the cot\nwhen there is a Bhumihar reaching the village. He organised people to oppose this in order\nto ensure that all elders are respected not the person of particular caste. On query about\nviolence against women , he informed that he did not hear about any though he found\npolice moving around in the villages in order to ensure prevention of untoward action. On\nthe query on the issue of Dayan and Witch, he said most of cases are reported due to\nproperty disputes and usurpation of properties by relatives.\nCase 39 :\nIn Interview Number 5 :\nMr. Ram Lakhan Ram, Retired Head Clerk, Department of Soil Conservation, President,\nSC/ST Workers Association, Deoghar , Jharkhand, Mobile :9470994120.\nHe informed that he has been active since student days fighting against superstition and\npromoting education, prevention of violence against women. On taking up the cases, he\ninformed that he had taken up cases of an SC employee who was being harassed. He\ninformed about a case of a Dalit woman who had not been elected in the Panchayat\nelection while the seat was for SC woman. On the reasons for violence on women, he said\nlack of education, presence of superstitious ideas and property dispute are the reasons for\nviolence on women.\nCase 40:\nIn Interview Number 6: (Interview with the representative of a political party)\nInterview with Mr. Sushil Das, Mobile Number: 9431150582, Deoghar, State Secretary,\nJanta Dal U, Jharkhand (a political representative as per the checklist).\nRDMA met Mr. Sushil Das and spoke on his understanding on the violence on Dalit and\nAdivasi women from within the community. He recognised the presence of ignorance on\ndiseases and its scientific reasons and therefore, this false attribution for women was\nbeing made by people who were visiting Ojhas rather than doctors for treating the\nillnesses. He informed on the case of an Adivasi woman who had been tortured by being\ncalled a Dayan since a child had passed away. On the query for whether he would be\nassociating with Rashtriya Dalit Mahila Andolan (RDMA) for eradication of violence on\nwomen through false allegations and false attribution of disease and deaths due to\nillnesses happening in the rural areas which did not have access to quality mental and\nphysical health care. He informed that FIR was not lodged in most of the cases of the\nviolence on women across the communities for incidence of persecution due to the false\nallegation of being a witch /Dayan. On the query as to whether his party would be part of\nthe campaign against violence on women, he said, his party is committed to eliminate\nimpacts of superstitions from the society. On the reasons for incidence of violence, he said\nall this is happening due to lack of awareness of diseases that are not diagnosed well due\nto health service system not functioning well.\n102 | Page\nCase 41:\nName \u2013 Basmati Devi (name changed), Age \u2013 45 years, Caste \u2013 Badhai (lower caste),\nVillage \u2013 Gamhardiha, Panchayat \u2013 Kurhobindo, District \u2013 Giridiha, Jharkhand.\nOnce, there was rejoice and celebration at Ramchandra Modi\u2019s house in gamhardiha\nvillage of giridiha district, Jharkhand.

Ojha spent around two hours and\nconcluded that there is nothing and thus, he saved the life of Masomaat in a way. This\ncase shows that work with Ojhas is also important or rather most important so that he is\nmade to give only ayurvedic medication rather than engaging the warding off evils through\nsuggesting the existence of Dayans among Dalits and Adivasis.\nCase Number 53 :\nAlwa Devi, 45 years, Village Bhalgarha , belongs to Ravidas caste.\nAlwa Devi, 45 years, Village Bhalgarha , belong to Ravidas caste .She suffered the\naccusation after a person in his neighbourhood started bleeding from his mouth.

Once, they went to meet\nanother Ojha , they were told that Girija Devi was innocent.\nCase Number-55 :\nBadki, Village Kandbekha, Block-Gomia, District \u2013Giridih.\nBadki has been thrown out of her home with the accusation of being a \u2018Dayan\u2019/witch\nIgnorance and lack of perfect medical knowledge on disease has been a reason for false\nattribution and suffering for men, women and children in among SC and ST. Badki Mo\n,belonging to Santhal tribe is 65 year old believing in Sarna religion. She was thrown out of\nher village with the accusation of being a Dayan and as a result, she is living with her\nbrother in village Purandih where she is living now with intent for never going back. She\nhas been beaten several times whenever someone fell ill, someone passed away. When\nher younger son speaks for his mother, he has been also beaten. There have been\npanchayats in the village where people accepted their fault but again she was beaten and\nharassed. This happened even after relative of Badki Mo and SHG leaders went to\nKandvekha to meet the village head and asked them not to harras her and beat her. Even\nthen, she was beaten and accused of being a dayan/witch. Badki Mo is now living with her\nbrother without having her name on BPL and neither having widow pension. There is a\nneed to quickly work for such women who have been victims of violence with due\nprotection guaranteed. This case along with all other cases strengthens the argument for\nmass education, awareness programme in a mission mode in order to eradicate the\nsuffering of women who are being made victims for various reasons.\nCase 56 :\n108 | Page\nName - Rupumuni W/O Late Suhrai, Village \u2013Phiribanda, Giridih.\n65 years old Rupumuni has maternal place in village-chanaura, tola-parbaad. She is living\nwith her daughter in Purnadih, the place where she is married. After her marriage of her\ndaughter, husband passed away leaving wife and one and half year old daughter.\nRupumuni was brought to her maternal village saying her husband passed away due to her\nin laws killing his husband. They told her that she might be killed through black magic\nalong with her daughter. Rukumani came her maternal place and from there she married\noff her daughter. She called her in laws but they did not turn up. She is not going to her in\nlaws but reaches Chanaro sometime. This case presents a case where usurpation of the\nproperty appears to be the intent. She was terrorised with the consequence of death for\nher and her daughter since according to her in laws, her husband was killed by the \u2018bhoot\u2019\nfrom her maternal place.\nCase 57 :\nIn INT 1 : Name \u2013 Dr. R.P. Das, Sadar Prakhand Pravari, Giridiha, Jharkhand.\nThe study conducted indepth interview of a doctor, Dr. R.P. Das, who have been working\nin the area for the last 30 years. He asserted that today, majority of the villagers are\nuneducated and superstitious. Hence, they have a firm belief on the witch doctor (ojha)\nrather than the medical doctor. The villagers believe that without the prayers and\nofferings of the ojha, the patient would not survive. It is only after this that the option of\nmedical treatment is explored. It is also believed that there are some diseases which\ncannot be treated by the medical doctor and needs to be addressed specifically by an\nojha. He added, sometimes patients die due to delay in appropriate treatment. If the\npatient dies, the belief of existence of a witch gets further vindicated and the\n\u2018identification\u2019 of the witch starts. He has encountered many such cases where initially\nthe patient is taken to the ojha and on failure, he/she is bought for medical treatment.\nThe Ojhas also take advantage of the situation and influence the villagers. It is only when\nthe people are aware of the malicious intentions of the Ojhas and importance of medical\ntreatment, the practice would culminate.\nFurthermore, he is of the opinion that the practice of witch hunting is prominent among\nthe marginalised scheduled caste communities including Muslims and OBCs and\nparticularly, among women, both widow and married. Their strong belief in witch and\nwitch practices do not allow them to oppose such a superstitious practice. They give\nimportance to the Ojhas rather than the doctor. However, when the situation is beyond\ntheir control, they consult the doctor, which results in the death of a patient. Then, they\nblame or accuse doctor, witch, black magic, sorcery, etc for the death and motivate the\nrest of the villagers against them. Thus, there is a need to protest and aware people\nagainst it.\nLack of education is a driving force behind the belief and existence of witchcraft among\ncommunities. They also lack knowledge of laws and regulations pertaining to witch\nhunting due to which they suffer terribly. Dr. R.P. Das attempts to convince the villagers\nand pull them out from the well of superstitions. He also provides free of cost treatment\nand medicines to the poor villagers. According to him, there is need to change the mindset\nof the people. Since, there are poor medical facilities in the village, people depend on the\nOjhas for treatment which increases their belief in them and the superstition of\nwitchcraft. Although, the practice is still prevalent in many parts of the country, but, a\nsignificant change has been witnessed. Due to various awareness programmes, the\n109 | Page\nincidents are being publicized and the alleged person fights for justice, instead of covertly\nconcealing the incident.\nCase 58 :\nIn INT 2 : Name \u2013 Mr. Sushil kumar, Lawyer, Giridiha, Jharkhand.\nMr. Sushil kumar, a lawyer, has been in the profession for last 10 years. He said that\nalthough there has been progress in the country, but the people are still uneducated and\nsuperstitious. As regards to witch hunting, he said that he trailed a case but due to lack of\nwitness and evidence, the culprit could not be punished and the alleged victim could not\nget justice. It is a general practice that the culprit is set free due to lack of evidence\nagainst him/her. Moreover, even if punished, he/she is imprisoned only for 6 months or\nlevied minimal fine. However, he suggested extending the imprisonment to 10 years.\nMoreover, it becomes very difficult for the victim to register a case in the police station.\nAnd, if registered, amid all difficulties, the case is taken to the court and both the parties\nhad to attend the trial for nearly six months. In order to maintain peace and tranquillity in\nthe village the Code of 107 is usually administered.\nThe accusation of witch practice is a superstition. It is a general belief that if a woman is\nmore inclined towards pujas and prayers, then she is accused a witch. Moreover, if a\nsingle woman or widow has a possession of land or property, she is immediately alleged a\nwitch by her relatives with an intention to control her property. All the villagers support\nthe perpetrators and the victim is left alone and deprived. The Ojhas also mislead the\nvillagers by identifying mostly poor and helpless widows. Alongwith creating disputes and\ndifferences between villagers, family and individuals, the Ojhas simultaneously demand a\nhandsome amount for the treatment. But, if somebody in the Ojhas\u2019 family falls ill, then\nhe takes the patient to the hospital instead of treating himself. The efforts of Sushil\nkumar in protesting against the Ojhas and convincing the villagers went in vain. Whenever,\nsuch case arises, he tries to convince them and resolve the matter. He opined that the\npractice of witch hunting is prominent among the scheduled tribes and scheduled caste\ncommunities such as chamar, turi, dome, hadi, etc. Although, the practice is still\nprevalent, the situation has improved to some extent.\nCase 59 :\nIn INT 3 : Name \u2013 Ms. Sanju Devi, B.J.P. Mahila Morcha, Giridiha, Jharkhand.\nMs. Sanju Devi, a politician, has experience of 7 years in the field of politics. She stated\nthat in a society women suffers from and are exploited in various ways such as domestic\nviolence, battering, rape, dowry-related violence, drugs-related violence, female\ninfanticide, superstitions and, last but not the least, witch-hunting. These are all serious\nconcerns and needs to be addressed. And, it is prominent among the poor, backward and\nmarginalized communities of the society.\nShe narrated, once, in a nearby village, a woman died due to jaundice. Her husband had\nshifted to Surat for job opportunities. Due to delay on his arrival, the dead body was kept\nin the village for three days. This spread the rumour that the deceased woman was\npossessed by evil spirit and was a witch (chudail). Meanwhile, another woman in the\nvillage was suffering from jaundice and some were suffering from ill-health. The villagers\ncalled the ojha to treat them. But, then, Sanju Devi and some of her associates reached\nthe place, protested against the ojha and arranged for treatment of the women. Within no\ntime, the women recovered from illness. She informed that the villagers have a firm belief\non the ojha and he controls the mind and behaviour of the villagers. He creates\ndifferences between them. 75 percent rural people are still surrounded by superstitious\n110 | Page\nbeliefs and rituals of witchcraft. With the help of the party, Sanju Devi organised\nprogrammes in various districts and villages and tried to convince and aware people about\nthe baseless belief and the consequences of such belief. Thus, she stated that it is due to\npeople\u2019s consciousness & awareness that, now-a-days, such incidents are being revealed\nand efforts is being made to end it.\nCase 60 :\nIn INT 4 : Incharge of police station, Giridiha, Jharkhand.\nThe incharge of the police station revealed that he has been working in the post for last\ntwo years. He said that there is prevalence of witch, witch practices, dian, etc. in the\nsociety due to lack of education. The other factors responsible for witchcraft are lack of\nsocial bonding between villagers, lack of knowledge about the laws and regulations and\nsuperstition. He added that such instances are prominent among the poor and scheduled\ncaste community rather than higher community. On enquiring about experiencing any such\ncase, he reported that till now there has not been complaint of any serious case of witch\nhunting in their police station. The cases are usually resolved at the panchayat level.\nEarlier, the phenomenon of witchcraft was not revealed, but, now, within no time, the\nincidence is exposed by the media. Hence, the cases are registered in the police station\nand then taken to the court for trial. However, due to lack of evidence and witness, the\nperpetrators are not punished. Rightly, the menace of media is playing an active role in\ndecreasing the incidences but in order to eliminate the instances of violence on Dalit\n,Adivasi women , awareness programmes need to be organised consistently engaging\nwomen, explaining the diseases and how these are attributed witches wrongly by Ojhas\nwho do not have comprehensive knowledge on diseases and reasons of death.\nCase 61 :\nIn INT 5 : Name \u2013 Mr. Arvind kumar, Newspaper Journalist, Giridih, Jharkhand.\nThe study also conducted in-depth interview of the journalist, Mr. Arvind kumar who has\nan experience of 22 years in the field of journalism. He is of the opinion that today,\nmajority of rural women face the discrimination, exploitation and violence due to dowry-\nrelated practice. Although, education played a vital role in the development of urban\nareas, but, it could not impact the backward areas. Now also, in some backward areas,\nthere is prevalence of child marriage. As regards to witch hunting, he stated that once he\nhad also protested against the persecution of witch practice and the practice of Ojhas. He\ntried to convince the villagers but in vain. He tried to threaten the ojha on the dire\nconsequences of misleading the common villagers but the ojha retaliated and said that if\nthe villagers belief him and eagerly seek his advice then how can it be stopped. It is due\nto lack of education and people\u2019s traditional mindset, which nurtures such superstitions in\nthe society. The Ojhas take advantage of the situation and create differences between\nvillagers to fulfil their materialistic requirements. Although, there has been development\nin health care facilities in the villages, still people are influenced by the fraud Ojhas. As a\nresult, the alleged woman is boycott from the society.\nWhile narrating an incident of witch accusation and persecution, Arvind kumar said that\nonce in Boingabad block, a son accused her own mother for being a witch and lynched\nher. As regards to the laws and regulations of witch hunting, it is usually seen that the\ncase is not registered in the police station and the villagers try to resolve it at the\npanchayat level. Moreover, at the panchayat level, no substantial action is taken against\nthe culprit, instead the alleged victim is either banished from the community or levied a\nhefty fine. Hence, the villagers are tried to persuade through the medium of media. He\nadded, although there are introduction of various Laws and Acts regarding witch hunting,\nbut, the common villagers are either not aware about it or fear it. He suggested\n111 | Page\nencouraging social behavioural-change intervention rather than awareness programmes to\nend such practice.\nCase 62:\nIn INT 6: Interview with Ramdev Vishwabandhu, Giridih, A Social Activist.\nMr. Ramdev Vishwabandhu has been working against social evils like the attribution of\nDayan, caste discrimination, poverty, dowry, drinking intoxicating drinks, usury. He\ninformed about the panchayat meetings in which he has been involved in villages like Bijla\nBathan, Mohanpur, Sihodih in which women belonging to Koiri, Chamar caste were\ninvolved as victim of being accused as a dayan. He said that women who had been accused\nwere in the range of 28-50 years. He believe that existence of Ojha is a burden \u2018Ojha is\nBojha\u2019 for society .There is a need to educate the Ojha, find him alternative livelihood\nrather than being an agent of victimising women through making her the source of disease\nand death without understanding the reason of death. He said caste system is another\nfalse idea that is imposed and then we have this false ideas like bhoot ,pishach that is\nmade part of the live of lower castes in order to keep these castes remain in ignorance.\nHe informed that there are at times, when there are properties involved and some\nwanting to usurp the rights of relatives or the accused come up with accusations for\nharassing her and making her mentally dysfunctional, psychologically traumatised.\nIgnorance generate suffering can be eliminated with knowledge. He informed about his\nwork on forest rights, capacity building of the panchayat members and training of member\nof the Joint Forest Management. He said he would be including education on eliminating\nsuperstitions in order to have cleared hundred percent accesses to health care for people\nso that people have a clear understanding on disease. Mental Health awareness\nprogramme needs to be conducted in order to ensure that Dalits and Adivasis in the\nremote villages are aware of reasons for illnesses caused by nutrition deficiencies and lack\nof psychosocial support.\nBihar\nWomen in rural India suffer from and are exploited in various ways such as domestic\nviolence, battering, rape, marital rape, incest, dowry-related violence, female\ninfanticide, sexual harassment, human trafficking for prostitution and, last but not the\nleast, witch-hunting. The practice of witch and \u2018witch-hunting' in parts of India appears to\nbe prevalent among certain castes and tribes. However, in recent years, in Bihar, many\nincidents have been reported regarding the violence meted out to SC/ST women due to\nallegations of witchcraft. Thus, the existence and extent of witch practices and witch\nhunting in Govindpur village, Hilsa block of Nalanda district, Bihar is illustrated in detail in\nthe following lines. Govindpur village is nearly 2 kms from Hilsa block. On the way to\nMaika tola of the village, at a distance of 20 meters, on both sides of the road, there are\ntwo storey houses of Thakurs and Redas. The Dalit basti, located at a distance of few\nmeters has 22 kutcha houses of Redas and Paswan. Apart from them, the basti is also\ninhabited by Beldar, Kurmi, Yadav and Srivastava castes people. On conversing with some\nof the women from the village, it was observed that they firmly believe in the presence of\nwitches and the practice of witch craft. It was reported that many women in the village\nare \u201cwitches\u201d and practice witchcraft, due to which some innocent people have suffered a\nlot, even died.\n112 | Page\nCase 63 :\nName \u2013 Sharmila Devi, W/O Binad Ravidas, Village \u2013 Govindpur, Tola - Maika, District \u2013\nNalanda, Bihar.\nSharmila Devi, aged 40 years, resides in Dalit basti of Maika tola of Govindpur village with\nher husband, Binad Ravidas and four daughters and two sons. Her husband works as a\nGovernment Driver. Since her marriage, she is constantly been suffering from ill health,\nweakness, unconsciousness and fatigue. The treatment of doctor also couldn\u2019t recover\nher. Finally, she was taken to the local Ojha for treatment. The ojha\u2019s treatment i.e.\npuja, offerings, chanting mantras, etc. went for almost 2 years, but did not give desired\nresults. Now also, she is suffering from the same problem. Her brother-in law and sister-in\nlaw, who reside in the neighbourhood, allege her as a \u201cwitch\u201d and assault her physically\nand mentally. Even the villagers, now-a-days, have also started accusing her as a \u201cwitch\u201d\nand responsible for anybody\u2019s death. Likewise, many SC/ST women in the village are living\na life of fear and anguish.\nCase 64:\nName \u2013 Manju Devi, W/O Vijay Ravidas, Village \u2013 Govindpur, Tola - Maika, District \u2013\nNalanda, Bihar.\nManju Devi, aged 45 years, though a very extrovert person believes in the superstition of\nwitches and witch practices. She resides with her husband, Vijay Ravidas and four\ndaughters and two sons in Dalit basti. Ravidas\u2019s first wife also resides in the same basti\nwith her 24 year old son. She usually comes to meet Ravidas, which creates distress in\nManju\u2019s family. However, Manju alleged her sister-in law to be a \u201cwitch\u201d and practiced\nwitchcraft on her newly born grand-daughter. As a result, her grand-daughter died on the\nsecond day of her birth. Finally, the ohja of the village confirmed that the child died due\nto evil spells and deeds by her sister-in law. Since then, all the villagers also regard her as\na \u201cwitch\u201d and discriminate and exploit her. This shows the extent of belief in the minds of\nrural people regarding the superstition of \u201cwitches and \u201cwitch-hunting\u201d.\nCase 65 :\nName \u2013 Sundari (widow), Village \u2013 Mathadiha, Tola - Harijan, District \u2013 Nalanda, Bihar.\nThere are various instances of witch accusation and persecution in India because of\nproperty disputes and personal vendetta. And, these are mainly inflicted upon the socially\nexcluded castes and tribes women especially widow, divorced or separated. Thus, the\npresent case is of Sundari, a widow of harijan tola of mathadiha village. 10 years ago,\nPrabhudas, a relative of Sundari suddenly died. He was a young boy. The parents and\nother relatives of the boy started blaming Sundari for his death. They accused her as a\nwitch and tortured & abused her terribly. She was forced to drink urine and other wastes.\nShe was even dragged and tried to set on fire. But, the villagers came to her rescue and\ntook the matter to the panchayat. The panchayat decided to seek advice from the local\nOjha before taking the decision of punishing the culprit. The family members of the boy\nand some of the panchayat members consulted the Ojha for nearly 2 hours, but in vain.\nThus, finally, the case was settled then and there and no one was punished.\nCase 66 :\n113 | Page\nName \u2013 Girja Devi, Village \u2013 Bakshidiha, Tola - Harijan, District \u2013 Nalanda, Bihar.\nIn harijan tola of bakshidiha village, Deepak Das\u2019s son, aged 5 years was ill due to some\ndisease. He was not recovering by doctor\u2019s treatment and medicine also. Finally, deepak\nalongwith some villagers went to the Ojha for his recovery. The Ojha told him that the\nreason of the boy\u2019s illness is his neighbour girja Devi. She is a \u201cwitch\u201d and practicing witch\ncraft on him. He advised him to perform some pujas and offerings to cure his son. On\nhearing this, deepak went to girja\u2019s house and started scolding, abusing and beating her.\nMeanwhile, girja\u2019s husband came to her rescue and was also beaten badly. When the case\nwas taken to the panchayat, the members decided that 10 people from the village will go\nand consult the Ojha and then punish the culprit. The villagers went to another Ojha in\nthe village who confirmed that girja Devi was not a \u201cwitch\u201d and should not be punished.\nCase 67 :\nName \u2013 Sia Saran Paswan, Village \u2013 Gajendra Vigaha, Block \u2013 Hilsa, District \u2013 Nalanda,\nBihar.\nSia Saran Paswan is a resident of Gajendra Vigaha village of Hilsa block.

However, they had a belief that she was possessed by some evil spirit or witch.\nSia Saran stated that, his younger daughter is also suffering from ill health due to the\nsame evil spirit or witch. On seeking advice, the ojha informed that the reason of his\ndaughters\u2019 illness is because of a witch who demands offering worship to her. But, Sia\ndenied worshipping her, since they belief that unmarried girls become impure on being\nworshipped. Thus, this mounts their agony, suffering & humiliation.\nCase 68 :\nName \u2013 Rambalak Ravidas , Village \u2013 Chamar Vigaha, Block \u2013 Hilsa, District \u2013 Nalanda,\nBihar.\nRambalak Ravidas is a resident of chamar vigaha village of Nalanda district.

On reaching, he was\nshocked to see that the door of his house was locked and a wall was constructed infront of\nthe door. This infuriated him and he had a confrontation with the neighbours and the\nvillagers who disrespect and humiliate the couple for not having a male child. The\nvillagers even accuse his wife as a witch and discriminate and humiliate her. Since,\nRambalak is without a male heir, some of the villagers and relatives make efforts to grab\ntheir property. Thus, it is a general practice that any family that accumulated land or\nproperty was subjected to envy and those people with a claim over the land or property\nare often the ones who initiate witch accusations in order to immediately takeover the\nproperty.\nCase 69 :\nName \u2013 Rita Devi W/O Late Dhiraj Verma, Village \u2013 Durga, Block \u2013 Hilsa, District \u2013\nNalanda, Bihar.\nRita Devi, aged 26 years is a widow. She was married to Dhiraj Verma in 2001. She has two\nsons, one aged 4 years and the other 9 years. In 2007, her parents-in-laws passed away\ndue to some disease which could not be cured. Unfortunately, in 2010, her husband also\ndied due to some severe ailment. This incidence shattered her life. The villagers gradually\nblamed her of in-laws and husband\u2019s death by practicing black magic and branded her a\n114 | Page\nwitch. She suffered discrimination and humiliation from the villagers. However, she is an\nepitome of strong will and mindset and example for all those women who suffer the\naccusation of witch in their life. Alongwith, upbringing and educating her sons by engaging\nherself in daily wage labourer works, she completed her matriculation study. Today, she is\nworking as pulse polio coordinator and selling garlands of flowers. She also engages herself\nwith many social activities. But, today also, the villagers regard her as a witch and blame\nher for the death of her husband and in-laws. Rita Devi\u2019s account is a clear case of\ncommunity sponsored violence against a weak and helpless woman to grab her belongings\nafter her husband\u2019s death. When some villagers realized that a widow with two children\nwould have no one to turn for support, they conspired to take hold of her belongings and\naccuse her a witch.\nCase 70 :\nName \u2013 Rita Devi W/O Anuj Manjhi, Village \u2013 Shahapur, Block \u2013 Hilsa, District \u2013 Nalanda,\nBihar.\nThis is an instance of a woman facing the hardships and discrimination of a witch\nallegation. Ms. Rita Devi, a resident of shahapur village, was married to Anuj Manjhi 20\nyears back. After giving birth to a daughter, she frequently suffered from ill health. They\nconsulted the doctor also but she could not be recovered. Finally, the family members\ntook her to the ojha for treatment. The ojha informed that Rita Devi is being possessed by\na witch who is her own relative. The witch will cast evil spells, as a result of which she\nmight also die. The ojha advised them to perform two religious rites to get rid of the\nwitch. On agreeing, they gave Rs. 1500 to the ojha for the rites. Apart from demanding a\ngoat, a pig, two hen and new clothes, the ojha demanded Rs. 30,000 for performing the\nrites & offerings. Unable to give him the money, they called their own caste ojha for\nperforming the puja. Amid all sufferings, Rita Devi was alleged as a witch and practicing\nwitch craft.\nCase 71 :\nName \u2013 Kamala Devi W/O Bhushan Paswan, Village \u2013 Indoat, Block \u2013 Hilsa, District \u2013\nNalanda, Bihar.\nKamala Devi\u2019s case gives us a clear evidence of the profound belief & faith of the rural\npeople on the deceived Ojhas and tantriks. It also shows people\u2019s believe in the\nsuperstitious practice of witch & witchcraft. They envisage that without the prayers and\nofferings of the Ojhas, the patient (who is accused or possessed a witch) would not\nsurvive. Kamala Devi, resides in indoat village of Hisla block with her husband, Bhushan\nPaswan and two children. She believed that it is due to stepping over somebody\u2019s practice\nof black magic & sorcery, that since then, she is suffering from ill health. Failing from the\ndoctor\u2019s treatment, she went to the ojha. The ohja performed some rites and pujas to\ninstigate the witch. After that, the ojha identified the witch, named Mia sheikh, who\ndemanded being worshipped. They worshipped the evil spirit, but it did not affect kamala\nDevi\u2019s condition. Today also she is suffering from ailing health conditions. Moreover, she is\nbranded a witch and looked upon by the villagers. They humiliate, torture and\ndiscriminate her. Even, the villagers accused Kamala Devi of inflicting diseases on children\nand animals of the neighbourhood using black magic. Thus, allegation of witch &\nwitchcraft, the most effective weapon in rural India, is used to destroy a woman\u2019s life,\ndignity & social prestige.\nCase 72 :\n115 | Page\nName \u2013 Radhiya Devi W/O Siddeshwar Manjhi, Village \u2013 Indoat, Block \u2013 Hilsa, District \u2013\nNalanda, Bihar.\nRadhiya Devi, is residing in indoat village of Nalanda district with her husband. She\nbelongs to a very lower caste. She had a daughter, named Ritu, whom, she had married\noff to Sukhadi Manjhi of Kharjama village.

On day, when her daughter had come to meet her in indoat,\nradhiya Devi\u2019s uncle-in-law, a ojha, commented that her daughter could never live a\nhappy & contended life. Instead, in near future, she would suffer from ill health. After a\ncouple of days, her daughter fell ill and was paralysed. She had to stay in indoat with her\nhusband. After one year, she gave birth to a son and henceforth, her condition\ndeteriorated and was totally paralysed. Radhiya Devi took her to many Ojhas for\ntraditional treatment, but in vain. She could not be recovered even from modern medical\ntreatment and eventually died. Thus, radhiya Devi accused her uncle-in-law of casting evil\nspells and black magic on her daughter. She said that he has some special power of\ninfluencing and changing the life of people. However, in a span of time, her uncle-in-law\nalso died.\nCase 73 :\nName \u2013 Khushbu Kumari W/O Ranjit Ravidas , Village \u2013 Sakrole, Post Office-\nMahanandpur, Police Station \u2013 Deepangarh, Block \u2013 Hilsa, District \u2013 Nalanda, Bihar.\nThis instance is a case of violence, torture, humiliation and discrimination against a lower\ncaste woman and accusing her witch. Khushbu Devi, aged 25 years, married to Ranjit\nRavidas in 2003 and resides in sakrole village. She has a 7 years old son. Her husband is\nengaged in daily wage work. However, in a span of time, her husband developed the bad\nhabit of drinking alcohol, selling off things from his house and even physically torturing\nkhushbu. Annoyed and worried of her husband\u2019s habits, she shifted to a rented house in\nhilsa, near her parents. She thought that a change in a place might change her husband\u2019s\nhabits. But, this did not affect her husband. He, as usual, continued his bad habits and\nbehaviour. However, alongwith facing all these hardships, Khushbu was also tortured by\nher landlord. Her landlord deprived and discriminated her from accessing the basic\namenities such as water, toilet, etc. She was addressed as a \u201clower caste witch\u201d. The\nvillagers believed her of learning and teaching witchcraft and practicing it on their\nchildren and animals.

She\nfurther said that Ojha had also spoken before the death of her third son. She said that this\nOjha is the one who is telling people about her being a Dayan. RDMA team felt here a\n116 | Page\nconspiracy for keeping the Manjhi steeped in superstition ensuring that they do not\nprogress. The reasons for both deaths could be other than Jamundri Devi being witch.\nEducating Ojhas and such other people for having a scientific understanding of death and\ndisease should be one of the important programme goals in National Rural Health Mission.\nIf psycho-social and medical support is made available in the entire village and more being\naware of the problems, then we would not have many incidence of violence.\nCase Number-75 :\nKoshila Devi w/o Shobhi Majhi, Village \u2013Redi, Hilsa, District, Nalanda, Bihar.\nWhen Koshila Devi married and started living with her husband, she started having\nheadache sometime.

She got pain in her stomach then her in laws consulted again then\nChudail said that she would not be able to give birth .All this story appears to be result of\nproblems in sexuality or some problems in menstrual cycle that were attributed to\nChudail. Some started calling her home to have Bhoot and Chudail though this is clear\nmedical case that could have been dealth with by gynaecologist.\nCase 76 :\nName \u2013 Kanti Devi (widow), Age 50 years, District \u2013 Nalanda, Bihar.\nThis is the case of Kanti Devi, aged 50 years, a Dalit widow woman of Koairi caste.

Her mother-in-law was also alleged as a witch\nand practicing black magic & sorcery after the death of her mentally retarded husband.\nShe stated that if anybody in the village accuses any woman as a witch, then she is\nbranded and addressed a witch. Therefore, it is necessary to aware and sensitize people\nabout the laws of witch hunting.

Also, she shared that she is not always feeling well. Only when, she goes to\nOjha she gets well. If there had been mental health counselling , she would not have been\nrequired to go to Ojha for feeling well. This is another case where false attribution for\ndisease was made naming a lady rather understanding the reason for death.\nCase Number 78 :\nIn INT 1 : With Dalit Women in Maike Tola of Govindpur village ,Hilsa Block , District\nNalanda, Bihar\nRumours must be countered for women who are accused to be a witch.

Mahendra engaged himself in daliy wage labour works. He had the\nburden of nurturing his two daughters after the sudden death of his wife. Since, his\ngrandmother and father were Ojhas, so he was also forcibly alleged an ojha. But, the\nvillagers blame him for any mishappening in the village. They think that he is practicing\nwitchcraft on the victims and brutally assault him. He even did not get any help from the\npanchayat or sarpanch. His age and health condition also does not permit him to work. So,\nhe is dependent on both his married daughters for financial support. Thus, extreme steps\nshould be taken to end such a superstitious practice which ruins peoples\u2019 life.\nIn Jharkhand, the accusation and subsequent violence against socially excluded SC/ST\nwomen as witches and witch practices has been increasing. The women are accused of\nwitches and persecuted in various severe forms. This has raised many questions such as,\nwho are these women? What is their socio-economic background? What factors are\nresponsible for their accusing as witches? etc. Thus, in order to get the answers to these\nquestions, the present study explored the existence and extent of witch hunting in\nHazaribagh district, Jharkhand through various case studies which are illustrated below.\nCase Number 87 :\nThe Case of Kunti Devi who passed away due to neglect in the village of Chapna, Ghosi\nPrakhand, District, Jehanabad, Bihar.\nRanjit Kumar loses his sister Kunti Devi . She was 27 year only .She was not happy in\nmarriage and not getting all that he needed. According to Pinki Devi, sister in law of Kunti\nDevi , the later committed suicide because she wanted to marry elsewhere but this was\nnot possible. According to the assessment of assessment of RDMA, it is case of domestic\nviolence. Counselling on both sides would have addressed the issues better. It is so\nunfortunate that deaths are happening due to lack of proper counselling in the villages\nwhere there is a need to for same in order to ensure happy family life.\n121 | Page\nCase 88 :\nIN FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSION 1 : Police Station - Makdampur, District \u2013 Jehanabad,\nState \u2013 Bihar .\nAllegations against Dalit and Adivasi women for practicing witchcraft and witch-hunting\ncases are occurring with alarming frequency in Bihar but it is difficult to make accurate\nestimates since cases of witch hunting and killing are not registered under a separate\ncategory. The law enforcing authorities such as village sarpanch, police, court, etc. have a\ndiscriminatory attitude towards these alleged women. They operate along male centred\nnorms whereas principles and values are insensitive to women's realities. Thus, in order to\nknow the ground reality of the situation in Jehanabad district, some of our coordinators\nattempted to have a discussion with the sarpanch of different villages. The sarpanch of\ndifferent villages had gathered at Makdampur police station to meet the police authority\nto discuss about the safety and security of the villagers on the occasion of Holi. On\nenquiring about the situation of witch practices in the district, almost all the sarpanch\ndenied the prevalence of any such cases in their villages. However, one of the\ncoordinator, named Chunni Devi, residing in the same village stated that she knows a case\nof a widow in the village who was blamed as a \u201cwitch\u201d and tortured, abused and beaten\nbadly. When the case could not be registered in the present police station, she took her to\nJehanabad A.C.P where the case was registered. Except one sarpanch, rest of them\ndenied of occurrence of such a case in the village. The sarpanch said that although the\ncase was registered but decision was not taken since the authorities are also biased. To\nthis, another sarpanch added that although there is prevalence and practice of witch-\nhunting in the villages, it is usually resolved at the panchayat level, by giving\ncompensation to the naive. However, if the parties do not agree to resolve, then the case\nis taken to the court. But, then, such a practice does not aware people about the\ndiscriminatory treatment against rural women on such superstitions.\nThe perpetrators are not punished. So, there is need for awareness campaign and\nprogrammes related to witch hunting. They were of the view that the cases of witches and\nwitch practices are usually prevalent among two groups of the same caste community\nespecially lower caste or weaker section. Such types of cases are not prevalent among the\nhigher caste community. However, on probing about the cases of witch hunting, the police\nofficer stated that he has never in his service period come across any such cases. Instead,\nhe has come across the cases of Ojhas. He stated that Ojhas are found in all communities\nand now also villagers seek advice from the Ojhas regarding their social, familial,\nindividual as well as health problems. In Gaya, a spirit (bhoot) mela is organised, where\npeople visit to get rid of the spirits. He added that the Ojhas exploit the villagers socially,\neconomically and physically to fulfil their egotistic and selfish desires. Thus, in order to\naddress the superstitious issues of Ojhas, witches, witch practices, etc. the laws and\nregulations should be severe and effectively implemented. Policy should be developed to\nprevent SC/ST women from being accused as witches and other kinds of violence against\nthem by making strong laws.\nLaws that prevent discrimination against SC/ST women should be enforced. There should\nbe introduction of affirmative action programmes in education, health and employment to\nthem. Strategies should be formulated to address the root causes of witch-hunting, which\nwould help other non-political organizations working in this sector. The judicial system\nshould be sensitive to the plight of SC/ST women. There should be strengthening of public-\nprivate partnership. Lastly, more and more people should be awared through people-\ncentric awareness programmes and campaigns to alter the deep-rooted defective value\nsystem from society.\n122 | Page\nCase 89 :\nIn FGD-2 : Focus Group Discussion with the Sarpanches in the Police Station of\nMakhdoompur, District Jehanabad, Bihar\nSorting out the cases by Panchayats does not generate awareness on the punishment\nfor Dalit women exploitation\nDespite presence of women who suffer the accusation of being a \u2018Dayan\u2019 /witch , there is\na tendency to deny its existence since the number of the incidence is not very significant.\nThis became evident when Ms. Chunni Kumari, an activist of Rashtriya Dalit Mahila\nAndolan , associated with National Confederation of Dalit Organisation visited police\nstation of Makhdoompur in district of Jehanabad in the state of Bihar, India. The visit was\nmade on the occasion of the meeting with the Sarpanches in the area on the occasion of\nHoli . Chunni Kumari introduced the purpose of visiting the police station in order to learn\non the reports that may have reached the police. First of all Sarpanches said that they did\nnot know about such instance. However ,when Ms. Chunni Kumari insisted on the story of a\nwidows like Sarita Devi in the villages within Makhdoompur police region. Initially,\nSarpanches did not accept that there is any instance of witch hunting .The Assistant Sub\nInspector said that he did not know of any report. While the discussion was going on with\nthe detailed sharing by Ms.Chunni Kumari, one of the sarpanch came who said he knew on\nthe instance of women suffering from the accusations of being a witch. He informed that\nthere are cases of women accused of being a witch. He informed that a case has come to\nhim but the same was sorted out at village panchayat level. The case involved the same\ncaste. He further informed that the cases are generally reported from the so called low\ncastes. According to him, the cases sorted out at panchayat level is better rather than\ngetting the issues in the hand of police since people on both sides get harassed if a case is\nfiled and that case goes on and one without speedy delivery of justice. The person who\nhad persecuted the woman calling her witch dayan was socially punished and the accused\nwomen was compensated for the economic losses that were incurred . He said if the\noppressor party would not have accepted than the matter would have been taken to\npolice. Reflecting on the social and economic profile of women , Sarpanch said it is\ngenerally low wealth group women who are accused of being a Dayan and then generally\naccusations came from the same caste groups and not from others. He said, in his\nlifetime, he has not heard about the incidence of this happening in the higher caste\nwomen.\nMs.Chunni Kumari, RDMA activist said that with the local sorting out of the issues, there is\na negative outcome that is possible. People are not made aware that accusations being a\nwitch are a crime and there are punishments for the same. Also, she highlighted the need\nfor making awareness on the legal provisions which Sarpanches accepted. They all\naccepted that awareness meetings need to be organised in order to ensure that women\nare not persecuted through levelling the accusation of being a witch/Dayan. She\nhighlighted that through these accusations, women are exploited. In the discussion with\nthe police inspector, he shared that case of women being persecuted through the\naccusation of being a witch has not reached him but he is aware of the presence of Ojhas\nwho are reached by people for sorting out health related and other problems in\nanticipation of change in the situation that is found troubling. He informed that in Gaya\n123 | Page\ndistrict, there is a place where a fair of ghost is being organised where people go to meet\nOjhas for sorting out problems. On the understanding of the reasons for the existence of\nOjhas, the Police Inspector was aware that Ojhas are found across the castes and they are\nusing the existence of the problems for ensuring their psychological influence. In the\nprocess of delivering their remedies, there are Ojhas who are seeking money along with\nthe meat, intoxicating drinks and several other items that they call for performing\nincantations that are part of their remedies. Considering the mental health perspective,\nit is clear that psychological problems and problems of relationships and other injustices\nthat are part of the social existence are being sought to be remedied with the help of\nOjhas. He informed that whenever there is an instance of exploitation, he is visiting the\nplaces. On discussion the legal provision, it became clear that punishment is not severe for\nthe oppressors. On the query for the possession of the act, deputy station officer informed\nthat he did not have a copy of the Act. On the discussion on awareness programme, he\nagreed that joint work is needed in order to ensure minimisation of violence against Dalit\nwomen through the accusation of being a Dayan. Sarpanches and deputy station in charge\nexpressed their full support if RDMA and CADAM were to organise awareness programme\nfor ensuring elimination of oppression of Dalit women through accusation of being a witch.\nCase 90 :\nName \u2013 Meena Devi, Age \u2013 55 years W/O Bishun Majhi, Village \u2013 Doman Bagh, Block -\nKowakol, District \u2013 Nawada, Bihar.\nMeena Devi, a resident of Dakshinbari Mushari, belongs to a very poor and lower caste\nfamily.

The practice of witchcraft prevails in several districts of Bihar,\nparticularly Nawada, as cases have been reported. Thus, in order to have an account of\nthe perception of people regarding the presence of witch hunting in Nawada district,\nindepth interviews were conducted which is discussed below.\nCase 107 :\nIn INT 1: Name \u2013 Manohar Majhi, Village \u2013 Amarpur, Post \u2013 Amirica Bigahad, Police\nStation \u2013 Mufasil, District \u2013 Nawada, Bihar.\nThis is an instance of Manohar Majhi, aged 48 years and belongs to lower caste i.e.\n\u201cmajhi\u201d. He He narrates his experiences and accounts of relationship with his neighbours\nand the villagers. He resides in amarpur village with his wife, elder mother, two daughters\nand a son. He is engaged in agricultural works. His neighbour, Suresh Majhi, also belongs\nto a lower caste and engages in daily wage labour works. The socio-economic and\neducational status of the \u201cmajhi\u201d caste in the village is very poor. However, the villagers\nhave cordial relation with their neighbours as well as other caste people in the village.\nThey attend each other\u2019s festivals and functions and wherever needed help & support\nthem. Manohar Majhi also maintains friendly relation with his neighbour and other\nvillagers. He never creates any situation of confrontation with anybody. However, once,\nwhen fire broke out in his neighbourhood and engulfed the whole village, then some\nvillagers blamed Manohar majhi for the incident. But, Manohar did not complain against\nthe person because he apologised. In another incidence, when a woman was accused and\npersecuted a witch in the village, Manohar came to her rescue and she was saved. But, the\nvillagers blamed and discriminated him & his family. Thus, it is evident that while the\nvillagers have a friendly verbal relation with the lower caste people in the village, but,\nthe ground reality is different. Firstly, the people have a firm belief in the presence of\nwitch and witch practices and secondly, they blame and discriminate the lower caste\npeople on account of witch practices. He further stated that he believes the Ojhas and\nfakirs, since his grandson was cured from some ailment after performing some rituals and\nrites by the ojha. It was evident from the information provided by Manohar that the\nvillagers also practice untouchability in the case of epidemic like diarrhea, cholera,\nmalaria, etc. which reveals their superstitious nature\nCase 108 and 109 :\nIn INT 2 and 3 with description of cases\nInterview with Hirankant Jha, Munshi, Police Station, Nawada City, District, Nawada,\nBihar:\nDeath of a Boy Suffering Injuries due to fall from a tree is attributed falsely to a witch\nand an HIV AIDS victim dying from AIDS is attributed to Witch. Police investigation\nexposes the truth\nThe purpose of the interview was to learn on the data related to reports on the\npersecution of women as a result of the accusation of Dayan. He informed that only one\ncase has been reported since he joined the police station. He did not have the report from\nearlier period. For him, police station is place of compromise and when cases are coming\nthen FIR is not registered. But according to him if there is someone reported to have\nbeaten a woman, then he is called to the police station and beaten and then left . On the\nuse of influence , there are some who wish to influence the police but then , due course\nof laws are followed considering the legal rights of women to protection from violence .\n131 | Page\nOn the social profile of people who are reporting the case of Dayan, he said that these\ncases are from the scheduled castes. There are times when reason of death is not known\nproperly as this happened once when a boy passed away and then there were some who\nreported that a Dayan has been involved . When the matter was investigated, it was\nfound that boy had fallen from a tree. There are incidences when upper caste people\naccuse SC and ST women for oppressing them. He felt that an honest police officer can\ndeliver justice but for extorting money from those persecuted women, there are instance\nwhen police officials are seen to be covering up the fact after receiving bribe for the\nsame.\nThus, it is important to ensure that police official bound with the duties is particular in\ndelivering justice. He confessed that instance of beating and mental torture through\nleveling the accusation of being a Dayan is generally not recorded. Person is called,\nrebuked and then let off. On the query for sufficiency of the legal provisions, he said laws\nare enough for preventing atrocities on women. Informing on the case from SIkandarpur\nvillage, he informed that a man living in Gujarat used to come after every two years and\nthe contracted AIDS and passed away before Holi. An old woman was being accused of\nbeing a Dayan. She reported this to police and then police became active. Finding the\nreality, police asked the wife of the dead man to testify that he had AIDS that he\ncontracted due to unsafe sex with other women. Concluding the interview, it was\nobserved that upper caste people are also engaged in using this work for oppressing Dalits.\nAlso SC and ST being the poorest are more prone to accuse women being a Dayan /Witch.\nCase 110 :\nIn INT 4 : Arjun Ram c/o Radha Devi, Secretary, Nirman Sewa Samiti,Gopal Nagar ,\nNawada, Bihar\nHe informed that he was working for ten years against caste based discrimination .He\ninformed about preventing people if there were some calling some women , a Dayan. On\nthe recent trends, he said people were believing in Jadoo tona but now with education ,\npeople are learning more on disease and death .He felt that Ojha was responsible for the\nprevalence of such faiths , since he was also making a gain in kind and cash trough\nreceiving goat, pig, chicken, clothes, alchohol. He said his organisation have been\nworking for sorting out issues ,mitigating conflicts and making people understand each\nother .If there are some accusations to a woman then panchayat is called for solving the\nproblem and ensuring the women are not oppressed and persecuted as a result of false\naccusation of being a Dayan. The issues are not permitted to be taken to police station in\norder to protect people from economic distress. On the programmes conducted, he said\nawareness meetings had been organised in the villages twice in this regard and now there\nis result for this. Even if people have this thought in the mind, they are not being to utter\nthe word \u2018Dayan\u2019 for any lady. He said no Ojha is permitted to enter the village in order to\nmisguide people and this is the reason, there is no more incidences of women being\npersecuted through the accusation of being a Dayan.\n132 | Page\nCase-111:\nIN FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSION 1: Village \u2013 Sismo, Panchayat - Mahuli, District \u2013 Nawada,\nState \u2013 Bihar.\nOn 18th March 2014, a focus group discussion was conducted among the Dalit women of\nSismo village of Mahuli panchayat, Nawada, Bihar. It was mainly organised & coordinated\nby the team of Mahamaya Vikas Sansthan, Nawada and Dalit Mahila Andolan. It was headed\nby Vandana Devi, Head, Mahamaya Vikas Sansthan. The main topic of discussion was the\npractice of witch hunting and the discrimination & violence against Dalit women on the\nsuperstitious accusation of witch. However, the discussion was attended by around 50\nDalit women who are now also blamed as witches by Ojhas or tantriks. The discussion\nstarted with the question to the women: whether they have come across any case of\nwitch, witch practices or violence in their village? Some of the women stated that they do\nnot believe in the presence of witches and no woman is blamed as a witch, but they have\ncome across cases of casting evil spells and magic charms. The villagers believe that those\nwho cast evil spells and magic charms are termed as witches. Furthermore, if someone in\nthe village dies or suffers from any disease, then the family members seek advice from the\nOjhas (gunias, mati or tantrik), who assures them that the culprit is a witch.\nMoreover, on questioning, whether the villagers believe the Ojhas, a woman named\nBasanti Devi said, 10 years ago, a woman was blamed as a witch by the ojha of the village.\nThen, the villagers humiliated, tortured and killed by setting her on fire. Although, now\nalso the villagers believe in witches and witch practices but such type of incidences have\nnever occurred again. The prevalence and practice of witch hunting is mostly found among\nthe Dalit and Adivasi communities. She further added that the village is inhabited by\nvarious dominant caste communities, which in turn affect the overall development of the\nvillage.\nOn probing about how to address the issue, the women stated that there should be\nawareness campaigns & programmes in the village regarding witch hunting. People should\nbe motivated, encouraged and convinced to cease such a baseless practice or belief which\nis a mere illusion. Thus, on agreeing to support awareness programmes in the future, the\nwomen affirmed that there should be such group building exercise among women within\nthe communities not only to create a network of support system at the grassroot level but\nalso to extend opportunities of socio-economic development. Lastly, the women\u2019s\ncollectives/sanghas also become the secure point for initiatives in health awareness and\nadult literacy that appeal to the fundamentals of this social evil.\nIn recent years, in Bihar, many incidents have been reported regarding the violence meted\nout to women due to allegations of witchcraft. The practice of witchcraft prevails in\nseveral districts of Bihar, particularly Rohtas, as cases have been reported. Thus, in order\nto have detailed understanding of the dimensions, existence and extent of the witch\nphenomenon in the districts of Bihar, indepth interviews of doctors, sarpanch, police\nauthorities, political and social leaders, etc. were conducted which is discussed in the\nsubsequent section.\nCase 112 :\nIn INT 1 : Name \u2013 Dr. A.K.Chaudhary, M.B.B.S, Primary Health Centre, Block\u2013 Katghat,\nDistrict \u2013 Rohtas, Bihar.\n133 | Page\nDr. Chaudhary, a resident of Patna, has been working in the Centre for last 4 years. On\nprobing, whether he has come across any case of violence of women due to allegations of\nwitchcraft, he stated that he has never come across any such cases. He added that during\nthe last 4 years, not a single woman accused a witch has come for treatment suffering\nfrom physical violence. He denied of having any information of presence of witch or witch\npractices in the villages. Thus, it is apparent that the Ojhas, tantriks, gunias, etc. play a\ndominating & influencing role in the lives of the rural marginalized and excluded\ncommunities.\nCase 113 :\nIn INT 2 : Name \u2013 Mr. Ranjit Pratap Singh, A.S.I. Police Station - Katghat, Block\u2013\nKargahat, District \u2013 Rohtas, Bihar.\nWitch-hunting, even when it does not involve killing, is an extreme form of violence. It\ninvolves destruction of property, physical and sexual assault, etc. This is a threat against\nall rural indigenous women. So, dealing with witch hunting certainly necessitates police\naction. But, according to Mr. Rangit Pratap Singh (A.S.I) for the last 3 years of his service\nperiod in the block, not a single case of witch hunting has been reported. He stated that\nthere is non-existence of witch or dians in their block. However, there are Ojhas/gunias\nand people belief them a lot. Furthermore, if there is any such case of witch accusation or\nwitch practice in the village, it is not being reported in the police station, thereby, no\nfurther action could be taken.\nCase 114 :\nIn INT 3 : Name \u2013 Hadish Ansari, Sarpanch, Village - Konar, Block\u2013 Shivsagar District \u2013\nRohtas, Bihar.\nIn order to have an understanding on the issue of witch hunting, Hadish Ansari, sarpanch\nof konar village of Shivsagar block was interviewed. He believed in the presence of witch\nwho casts evil spells and practices black magic. The witch is called a \u2018dain\u2019 in local\nparlance and believed to cause ailment to people and animals. Initially, she is usually\nidentified by an Ojhas or gunias. The process of identification of the witch is specified by\nthe Ojhas by looking into the symptoms of the patient. The alleged recipient of witchcraft\nis usually seen suffering from symptoms like, fever, cough-cold, fatigue, weakness,\nparalyses, hysteria, etc. As soon as it is believed that a disease has been caused due to the\n\u2018witch craft\u2019 people try to get rid of the spell through prayers and offerings. People\nbelieve that without these prayers and offerings the patient would not survive. It is only\nafter failure from Ojhas that they seek medical treatment. However, it is believed that\nthere are some diseases which cannot be treated by the medical doctor and needs to be\naddressed specifically by an ojha. Sometimes patients die due to delay in appropriate\ntreatment. If the patient dies the belief of existence of a witch gets further vindicated\nand the identification and persecution of the witch starts. It so happens that she is either\nbanished from the community or killed. He stated that around 75% of the people in rural\nareas believe in black magic & sorcery and they talk about the presence of witch. Today,\nthere are 10 Ojhas in the village who are poor and belongs to lower caste community.\nMoreover, there is also evidence of existence of class and caste based discrimination in\nthe village.\nCase 115 :\nIn INT 4 : Name \u2013 Hakim Warsi, Sarpanch, Village - Konar, Block\u2013 Shivsagar District \u2013\nRohtas, Bihar.\n134 | Page\nAnother sarpanch, named Hakim Warsi stated that although the villagers believe in witch,\nwitch practices, black magic, sorcery, etc. but they do not reveal. The trend of witch\nhunting has engulfed everybody, from rich to poor, from higher caste to lower caste, from\nliterate to illiterate, etc. Peoples\u2019 believe in Ojhas has become a mere traditional &\nreligious business for them. There have been no attempts to address the issue. He was of\nthe opinion that there should be awareness campaign to convince the people that their\nbelief in such superstitious practice is baseless and illogical.\nCase 116 :\nIn INT 5 : Name \u2013 Bhola Shankar, Organization - Gramiya Mazdur Sangathan, Mohala \u2013\nBharti Gunj, Village - Sasaram, Block\u2013 Sasaram District \u2013 Rohtas, Bihar.\nMr. Bhola Shankar is a resident of Sasaram. Since 1974, he has been working as a leader in\nthe Gramiya Mazdur Sangathan for the social, economical and political rights of the poor,\nmarginalized, Dalits, Adivasis, Muslims and women. He has also worked against the\nsuperstitious mindset of the people by organising awareness campaigns, andolans and\nmeetings in different villages of Rohtas district. The meetings were mainly organized to\naware people about the baseless belief of witch, Ojhas and witch practices. The Ojhas are\nforced to reveal their selfish motives to the people in the meetings. They are threatened\nby saying that if they don\u2019t reveal, then they will be taken to the police for action. As a\nresult, they disclose their motives. The andolans and meetings had a great impact on the\nlives of the people. They, apart from seeking advice from the Ojhas, explored the option\nof going to doctor for treatment. However, sometimes, their belief in the practice\ndominates their mind, for which majority turn to Ojhas. In order to address the issue, are\ntwo major andolans were initiated in the district. One was the Triveni Sangh of the Koyari,\nKumri and yadav caste people, and the other was the Ajay Sangh, which mainly dealt with\nthe superstitions. These andolans were very active and had a great impact on the people.\nBut, gradually, after the death of their leaders the andolans weakened, but still\nfunctioning. Thus, according to Mr. Bhola, the Government, civil society organizations,\npeoples\u2019 associations, etc. should take strong steps to put an end to the practice of witch\nhunting.\nCase 117 :\nIn INT 6 : Name \u2013 Siwadhar Rai, Organization \u2013 Jaipravah Vikas Mandal, Mohala \u2013\nPunjabi Mohala, District \u2013 Rohtas, Bihar.\nSince 1966, Siwadhar Rai has been working against the superstitious perception of society\nagainst Dalits and other lower caste community. The lower caste Dalits has been facing\nthe hardships of discrimination and violence since ages. He asserted that if a Dalit sits on\nthe bed or chair in the presence of higher caste people, then he is severely exploited and\nbeaten badly. Further, in one instance, when a Dalit boy was going to get married, sitting\non a horse, he was physically tortured and beaten badly. However, at that time, Siwadhar\nRai and some of his coordinators rescued the boy and organized protests and andolan\nagainst it. As a result, the discrimination against Dalits in the village decreased to some\nextent. Nevertheless, the belief of villagers against witch and witchcraft still existed. In\n2005, a Dalit woman working in the organization was alleged as a witch and eventually,\nburnt alive. The case was registered and the proceedings went on for many years. The\nfactors responsible for existence of witch and witch hunting in the society can be\nattributed to inequality, illiteracy, belief in religious, spiritual and supernatural powers,\npoverty, etc. Siwadhar stated that the organisation has protested and conducted various\nandolans in different villages against such a practice, which in turn, resulted in lower\nincidence of witch belief and practices.\n135 | Page\nORISSA\nCase 118 and 119 :\nA female teacher accused a tribal girl and then later a boy for being a witch.\nGovernment relieves the teacher and makes the assistance in charge for Sewashram\nThe shocking incidence of the seven year old girl being thrown out of the school by the\nteachers on the charges of being a witch has finally waken up the Keonjhar district\nadministration in eastern Indian state Odisha. The Additional District Collector and the\npresent collector in-charge Sangram Keshari Swain, accompanied by the Sub-collector\nPratap Chandra Hota and District Education Officer Krushna Chandra Nayak have\nconducted an on spot enquiry.\nThe lady teacher have had abused the girl by calling her a witch. The victim a class one\ntribal girl has returned to the sevashram. This incident took place under Telkoi police\nstation in Keonjhar district, 280 kilometers away from the state capital Bhubaneswar.\nThe girl from Juladera Kenduadari Munda Sahi village of Khuntapada panchayat under\nTelkoi police limits was admitted to class one of Talasahi Sevashram a tribal residential\nschool last year. When her father dropped the girl in the Sevashram on January 03, after\nthe x-mass holidays, the teachers there refused her entry into the school.\nThe head mistress alleged that the girl was a witch, she turns into a cat in the night and\nsucks blood from other inmates. Pronouncing the verdict that a witch cannot be\naccommodated in the Sevashram hostel, the teachers threw away her belongings out of\nthe hostel.\nPrayers and request by the father of the girl Birsinh Munda could not bring in any sense.\nDejected, the father complained with the Tehsildar and the District Collector. The\ncollector swung into action to suspend the Head Mistress and restore the girl into the\nschool.\nBut, another student of the same Sevashram, Gurucharan Jamuda (9 years) was not that\nfortunate to invite immediate attention of the media as well as the district\nadministration. The investigating officials headed by the officiating district collector\nSangram Keshari Swain have found out that a similar incident had taken place in the\nschool last year.\nGurucharan Jamuda, a tribal boy was refused entry into the Sevashram on the grounds\nof being a witch by the same teacher. Father of Gurucharan, Budhilal Jamuda has\ncomplained with the Block Development Officer and the district administration. While\nrepeated appeals did not yield any result, the family was compelled to admit the boy into\nanother school Durllavapur Primary School.\nBut for this the boy had to lose one year. He was admitted to class one, even though he\n136 | Page\nwas reading in second class while this incident took place. Apart from losing a year\nGurucharan also has to commute daily as this school does not have hostel facility. These\nSevashrams are run by the Tribal and Harijan Welfare department to facilitate education\nof the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe student. The boy is studying in class II at\npresent.\nThe District Collector has assured that stern action will be taken against those found\nguilty. For the time being the headmistress has been relieved of her charge. Siksha\nSahayak of the school has been entrusted with her charge.\nIt is noteworthy to mention here that barely a month back on 5th of December 2013,\nOdisha Legislative Assembly had enacted Odisha Prevention of Witch Hunting Bill, 2013.\nThis legislation provided for effective measures to tackle the menace of witch hunting and\nprevent the practice of witchcraft with evil intention to harm others.\nPenal provisions of minimum three years of imprisonment with a fine not less that Rs.1000\nhas been made for the crime of witch hunting, and abating or provoking for witchcraft.\nThe imprisonment could be up to five years also. For the second time crime it could\nextend up to seven years.\nHowever despite the risk of severe punishments, such incidents continue to happen in\ndifferent parts of the state as the information and awareness about such enactments is yet\nto percolate down to the masses.\nhttp://www.merinews.com/article/despite-new-laws-cases-of-witch-hunting-continue-to-\nsurface-in-odisha/15893752.shtml\nCase 120,121,122 and 123 :\nThree women stripped in Talsara in 2013 and one woman assaulted in 2005\nThree women were stripped naked in the village of Ambapada in Talsara police station\nareas of Sundergarth district in Odhisha as per the news published in First post\nhttp://www.firstpost.com/fwire/witchcraft-crowd-strip-three-women-in-odisha-\n622900.html published on February 2,2013. Those accusing the women blackened the\nfaces and then paraded these women naked in full public view. Some informed the police\nand when the police reached the village , the matter was being discussed in the village\n.Police rescued three women arresting three person according to the investigating officer\nMr. Padhi. the arrested persons were identified as Prafulla Barla, Ani Baa and Sanjam\nSoren. 9 years ago, a similar incident had happened when a woman accused of practicing\nwitchcraft has been assaulted and forced to eat human excreta at Tanesar.\n137 | Page\nKolkata\nCase Number 124 :\nAccording the news entitled \u2018Witch-hunting is not about the superstition\u2019 published in\nIndian News from Kolkata on May 9,2013 , Women are lynched, sexually exploited and\nforcibly evicted from their homes after being branded witches. Witch-hunting is not about\na stray report tucked away in a corner of the newspaper but an increasingly worrying pan-\nIndia trend that specifically targets women in a patriarchal society, say experts.\nWith reports of witch-hunting coming in from villages and even towns across the country,\nsociologists, women activists and others believe that it but another form of gender-based\nviolence. And women who stand out from the crowd, either because they have property,\nare good looking or independent are specifically targeted.\nThere have been increased instances of single women/widows being branded witches and\nmurdered when they refused sexual overtures of someone dominant in the village or in the\nfamily. In some cases, relatives branded them witches to grab their property.\nNGOs working in rural areas have found \"beauty and wealth\" to be the prime reasons\nbehind witch-hunts.\n\"It is less of superstition and more of a conspiracy, either to grab the property of the\nwoman or to take revenge for unfulfilled sexual intent in the case of younger women,\"\nsocial activist Shravani is reported to have told IANS.\nShravani has been working with rural women in what is now Jharkhand for the past 20\nyears. She said victims in most cases were young, good looking widows or single\nwomen/widows who had huge property in their names and were childless.\n\"Saloni Khujoor of Mandar village, an educated single woman, was branded a witch and\nkilled because society could not tolerate a woman being the heir of her father's property\nand people don't want to see women being self-dependent,\" said Shravani.\nSeveral NGOs in Jharkhand said that most cases go unnoticed and unreported as they are\nhushed up.\nRenowned Wiccan priestess Ipshita Roy Chakraverti blamed \"vested interests like property,\npersonal interest in the woman\" as the reasons for women being branded witches.\n\"More than 800 women have been killed after they were denounced as witches across the\ncountry since 2008. This is the official figure. The actual number may be higher,\"\nChakraverti I told IANS.\nIn a patriarchal society, an independent single woman is a threat, warranting immediate\nelimination.\nKeeriti Roy, a social worker from West Bengal, said almost all the cases of witch killings in\n138 | Page\nthe state had a close connection to property or other vested interests - and that rejection\nin love was also a reason.\nCity-based sociologist Bula Bhadra described witch killing as \"genderised mass murder\".\n\"The overall evidence makes plain that the panic of the witch craze is inseparable from\nthe misogynist stigmatisation of women as evil. Women who seemed independent from\npatriarchal norms have been targeted as witches. Labelling women as witches effectively\ndiverts attention from the daily multifaceted atrocities on women in India,\" Bhadra said.\nAccording to the National Crime Records Bureau, 243 women have been killed after being\ndenounced as witches across India in 2011, with Karnataka registering the maximum with\n77 cases, followed by Odisha with 41 and Jharkhand with 36. Many other states are also in\nthe list.\nG. Vijayan of The Atheist Centre in Andhra Pradesh said settling old scores was a primary\nreasons for witch-hunting besides land grabbing. Often, there is official neglect.\n\"In some parts of the Telangana region, when a woman is killed after being branded a\nwitch, a case is not even registered,\" he said.\nAccording to All India Democratic Women Association Odisha secretary Pushpa Das,\nwitchcraft is rampant in the state. \"In 2012 alone, around 50 such cases came up and most\nof the victims were single women.\"\n\"The government needs to be proactive. Without the administration coming forward, such\nkillings cannot be prevented,\" Shravani said\nhttp://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/wit\nch-hunting-is-not-about-superstition-say-\nexperts-22747.html\nFigure 8 A picture of woman accused of being a witch\nfrom India News report\n139 | Page\nAnnexure \u2013III Press news :\n140 | Page\nANNEXURE IV\nIdentity Number of Household\nWitchcraft among women in India: The Case of\nOdisha, Bihar and Jharkhand\nSection I: Basic Information of Household\n1.

Most of the dalit girls are still dropping out of\nschools owing to poverty but more to escape humiliation, bullying and isolation by\nclassmates, society and even the teachers. There is still the danger of molestation if the\nschool is away from the dalit habitation. The overall crime rate against SCs is\nconcerned, Rajasthan stands second at a rate of 6.2 against a national average of 2.4\nin 2005.\nIn spite of all the Constitutional safeguards as well as different laws meant to support\nwomen\u2019s honor and dignity, the strong impact of caste even on the judicial system has\nbeen witnessed in Rajasthan like that in the case of Bhanwari Devi. A look at the\nimplementation of laws on reforms like the PCR Act and the SC/ST Act for dalits shows\nthat there are many laws to bring about social equality but they have hardly made an\nimpact on the mindset of the upper castes. As per the directions of the state\ngovernment, the district collectors have been authorized to provide monetary\ncompensation to the victims as per their wisdom but the total amount distributed is very\nsmall compared to the number of offences.\nThis called for an objective assessment of violence against Dalit women in Rajasthan\nand the impact of the actions taken by the state government and the administration to\nimprove the situation and to save them from continued violence against both their\nbodies and minds. The objectives of the study included the type and extent of physical\nand social atrocities on dalit women, the role of the society and the government in\npreventing the atrocity, the exertions of rights of dalit women on their lands and the\ndifficulties faced by them in getting justice. Six districts with the highest number of\ncases of violence against Dalit Women were selected and from each district detailed\ncase studies were made in 15 cases. The districts were Sriganganagar, Kota, Jodhpur,\nBharatpur, Pali and Tonk.\nSecondary sources like newspaper reports, magazines, reports of other governmental\nand non governmental agencies addressing these issues of violence against the dalits\netc were used for situational analysis. Key informant interviews with the administrative\nofficials, judges, NGOs and other members of the public groups including dalit\n3\norganization were conducted to analyze the process of giving justice to the dalit\nwomen.\nIt was revealed that the dalit woman is far weaker than not only an upper caste woman\nbut also higher sub castes of Scheduled Castes and, therefore, prone to all forms of\natrocities. There is constant pressure of the upper castes on the dalit family and there is\nhardly much support by the dalit society to the dalit victim. The discrimination starts at\nan early age when the dalit girl has to leave school because they are teased on caste\nbased names. There is a widespread practice of untouchability, strongest in rural areas,\nwhere majority of the population resides. The dalits cannot enter temples and the dalit\nPanchas are not allowed to sit on chairs. The upper caste always interferes with the\nwork of dalit elected representatives.\nThe dalit women are castigated as sex workers. The most vulnerable is the single,\ndivorced, widow who is poor and is from a dalit caste. She is tagged as a \u2018Dayan\u2019 and is\nostracized from the larger society. In many cases even her own family starts hating her.\nThe result is that the woman becomes so weak that she is helpless when her land is\nbeing grabbed and she either lives in the village in utter poverty or goes away from the\nvillage.\nThe study reveals that the police routinely demands bribes, intimidates witnesses,\ncovers up evidence, and beats up the women's husbands. Little or nothing is done to\nprevent attacks on rape victims by gangs of upper-caste villagers trying to prevent a\ncase from being lodged or pursued. Police often refuses to register FIRs. The case\nregistration is delayed due to indifference of police officials and the accused prevent\nthem from going to police stations. The Police do not investigate cases fairly. The victim\nherself changes her statement sometimes due to social pressures. Some cases are\nwithdrawn as some of the victims register a false case because of the male politics in\nvillage and their families have a grudge against the alleged accused. In few cases the\naccused get arrested but released on bail by the court which is against SC/ST Act. The\nvictims during the course of the case go through a lot of mental, economic, social and\nfinancial trauma.\nThe study of the cases of violence in the six districts have brought out very clearly that\nthe enforcement of laws designed to protect Dalits is lax in Rajasthan. Although\nlegislation exists, measures to ensure its full implementation -- including communicating\n4\nprovisions to the public, training officials responsible for administering the legislation,\nproviding legal support services to enable beneficiaries to invoke legislation, monitoring\nimplementation and ensuring further development of legislation in response to the\nreality on the ground -- have not been sufficient. The machinery consisting of\ncommissions like the SC/ST Commission, the Human Rights Commission, etc have not\nbeen able to achieve the goals. The attempts by dalit women to seek justice through\nthe criminal justice system are regularly forestalled. The study concluded that this\nlegislation is not being fully implemented\nThe study suggests that powers should be granted to the National Human Rights\nInstitutions to establish an independent complaints and monitoring mechanism to\naddress the discrimination and violence against Dalit women. The machinery should\neffectively enforce provisions of Scheduled Castes & Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of\nAtrocities) Act 1989 it needs to be made more stringent at grassroots level i.e. Police\nStations by creating a separate cell to be manned by SC/ST officials for dealing with\nsuch cases and Section 4 of the Scheduled Castes & Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of\nAtrocities) Act 1989, which relates to \u2018Punishment for neglect of duties\u2019 needs to be\namended to include public servants belongs to SCs & STs.\n5\nCHAPTER - I\nINTRODUCTION\nDalit Woman raped in Jodhpur\nHT Correspondent\nJodhpur, May 14, 2006\nA Hardcore criminal of Jodhpur rural district raped a Dalit woman in the village\nRajsagar under Dechu police station on the intervening night of Friday and Saturday.\nThe police arrested the accused on Sunday following a protest and demonstration by\nvillagers before the police station, sources said.\nThe incident of rape took place when the victim was sleeping with her child. Her\nmother-in-law was sleeping in another room of the house, while other members of the family\nwere not at home.\nTaking the opportunity, criminal and resident of the village, Rawal Ram, son of Bhura\nRam Jat entered the house of victim and raped her at gunpoint. The victim tried to cry for\nhelp, but her mouth was gagged. He also threatened her not to tell anyone about the incident.\nAccording to sources, the victim told the story to other family members on their\narrival on Saturday morning. Incensed, they lodged a first information report (FIR) in the\nDechu police station but it made no impact on the police, who took the case lightly.\nThis angered the villagers and they staged a protest demonstration opposite the police\nstation demanding police action against the accused.\nThe police raided the places normally visited by the accused and took him into police\ncustody for further interrogation, but did not arrest him.\nThe frustrated villagers had to stage a dharna again on Sunday, demanding\nimmediate action against the culprit, before the police arrested the accused. Later, a medical\ncheck-up of the victim was carried out and a case was registered against Rawal Ram, the\npolice said.\nDo not get shocked. This is not an isolated incident. It is repeated ad nauseam in almost\nall the villages in Rajasthan with regularity. In this case at least the police intervened after the\npublic agitated. Mostly there is no police. No FIRs. No public or Dalit support to the raped\nvictim. She fights alone. For sometime there is parental or husband\u2019s support. Then every thing\nis forgotten. Some money passes hands. Some liquor is consumed by the victim\u2019s family. The\n7\nincident, however, remains etched within her, many a time haunting her when she is alone,\nthrough out her life, For the Constitution, the various general or specific laws of the country, she\nis no more a human being violated, but an FIR number ultimately consigned to records and moth\neaten.\nThe Hindustan Times report does not end where the reporter has ended it. The rapist,\nhowever hardcore he may be ultimately gets his way through and is acquitted by an honourable\ncourt of law.\nThere is another very serious case of murder when the Rajputs kill a Meghwal dalit in\nPali district for affectionately calling his daughter \u201cBai Sa\u201d. The village is not having a very\nlarge population of non-dalits but their fear and feudal influence can be seen everywhere. The\nincident occurred on 7th July 2000 when the victim Chunnilal Meghwal was bringing water on\nhis bicycle in the morning. In front of a house of a Rajput he was struck by a few Rajput men\nand women who started beating him up with swords, lathis and knives. He tried to run but was\nforcibly taken inside the house of the Rajput, Bharon Singh, where he was again beaten up and\nhis limbs broken. The injured victim kept on lying on the floor for more than two hours. In the\nmeanwhile, the police was informed but it did not come for a long time. It reached only when he\nwas dying but his dying declaration was not recorded.\nThe Rajputs were annoyed because the victim used to pass by their houses without\ngetting off his bicycle and used to call his 8-year old daughter \u2018Bai Sa\u2019. \u2018Bai Sa\u2019 is a form of\naddressing a women by the Rajputs who would not allow any one else, especially the dalits to\nuse it. Therefore, the Rajputs were looking for an opportunity to kill the victim. Earlier, the\nvictim had been fined by the village panchayat for Rs. 11,500 for the\u2019offence\u2019. Although the\npolice official of the area at that time got the fine refunded, he did not register a police case, in\nspite of knowing that the life of the victim was in danger. Before this incident of 7th July the\naccused had tried to kill the victim but they could not succeed because they were seen by the\nvillagers. Even then the police did not act against the accused and registered a case of \u201cbreach of\nthe peace\u201d only.\nThe matter is still pending in a court of law. The accused were released on bail within a\ncouple of months of their arrest and they are now terrorizing the dalits.\nWhen the writer discussed the cases of violence against dalit women in a meeting in\nJodhpur, which was attended by the District Magistrate, the two Police Superintendents-Rural\nand Urban- the Prosecution, the NGOs, etc, he was told by the Superintendent of Police that the\nreal gruesome cases never came to light because the aggressors were so powerful that they could\nnip the reaction in the bud by terrorizing the dalit community. With most of the police station\n8\npersonnel now getting posted at the recommendation of the local upper caste politicians, the\ncases could never be registered against those who got them posted at the place of their choice.\nHe also narrated an incident when he wanted to help a dalit.\nIn most of the villages the dalits cannot wear chappals if they are passing through a lane\nwhere the upper castes are residing. On a visit to a village, he found that a man was walking\ndown a lane with his chappals in hand. He was asked the reason and was given the explanation.\nWhen he insisted that the dalit should wear the chappal and that he would ensure his safety, he\nfound that the dalit would not agree. The reason was simple. Protection given on this occasion\nwill lead to much more trouble for him later. The poor official gave up.\nNearly 90 percent of all the poor Indians and 95 percent of all the illiterate Indians are Dalits,\naccording to figures presented at the International Dalit Conference that took place May 16 to\n18, 2006 in Vancouver, Canada. Out of 200 million Dalit women in India. (= former\nUntouchables), nearly 50% are women, often referred to a \u2018thrice Dalit\u2019, as they suffer from the\ntriple oppressions of poverty, being female and being female Dalits. They are frequently let\ndown by both the Dalit movement itself as well as the women\u2019s movement in India that focuses\nmore on social problems like dowry deaths\u2014more relevant for caste women and not those\noutside the caste system. Many Dalit women are denied access to education, to meaningful\nemployment, health provision and are the first to suffer the negative effects of globalization.\nAccess to upper caste wells is forbidden. Worst of all, Dalit women are exposed to many forms\nof violence (including temple prostitution) and are frequently raped as a way to humiliate Dalit\nmen. The degrading work of \u2018scavenging\u2019\u2014removing human excrement-falls mostly on Dalit\nwomen, since men are more likely to be \u2018upwardly-mobile\u2019.\nWomen in India, particularly in states with feudal background like Rajasthan, are subject to\ndiscrimination not just on the basis of gender but on numerous other factors such as caste,\ncommunity, religion etc.\nIn such a society, at the lowest rung are the dalit women. A dalit woman faces violence and\nhumility not only from non-dalits but also from her own community.\nProvisions in the Indian Constitution\nThe right of equality is a fundamental one. However, the institutional forces arraigned\nagainst it are more powerful and exert control and shape people's mindsets. Factors like caste,\nclass, community, religion, locality, family, occupation all combine to affect dalit women and\n9\nmen alike, making them accept caste inequality as something given without the need for\nquestioning.\nArt 14 of the Constitution provides that \u201c the State shall not deny to any person equality\nbefore law or the equal protection of the laws\u201d. Art 15 states that \u201c State shall not discriminate\nagainst any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them.\u201d\nHowever, in spite of all the Constitutional safeguards and the Indian Penal Code and the\nCriminal Procedure Code safeguards for women as well as different laws meant to support\nwomen\u2019s honour and dignity, the strong impact of caste even on the judicial system has been\nwitnessed in Rajasthan in the case of Bhanwari Devi. It is a typical case of rape of a lower caste\nwoman as a weapon of retaliation used to punish and silence women\u2019s rights activists. After the\nrape, when Bhanwari approached the police, she was told that she was too old to be attractive to\na man and no one would like to rape her. When there was furore and the case was registered the\ntrial judge held that as all the accused were middle-aged they could not have penetrated her.\nAlso no upper caste man would defile himself by raping a lower caste woman!\nThis is also not an isolated case. There are many reported from all over the country. There is a\nstrong prejudice which women, especially, dalit women face all the way to the top of the judicial\nsystem.\nThe Indian Caste System\nThe Indian caste system is not a \u201c divine proclamation\u201d and the Vedas do not refer to any\nmandated caste system as a part of the Hindu religion. Moreover, other religions like Muslims,\nSikhs and Christians also practice it in some manner. Broadly speaking, the caste system can be\nviewed as a system of exploitation of the poor, low ranking groups by more prosperous high-\nranking groups. For ages, land has been largely held by dominant castes, high ranking owners of\nproperty that economically have been exploiting the low ranking, landless labour and poor\nartisans, simultaneously looking down upon them with ritual emphasis on their \u201c god-given\ninferior status\u201d.\nHuman Rights Violations\nIt is widely held in India as well as the rest of the world that most of the human rights\nviolations are against the dalits or the untouchables who suffer substantial discrimination.\nCustodial violence and killings continue unabated.\nDalits\nThe word dalit comes from the Marathi root dal and means \u2018held under check\u2019.\n\u2018suppressed\u2019 or \u2018crushed\u2019 or \u2018oppressed\u2019.\n10\nViolence Against Women\nLet us begin with the definition of the word \u2018violence\u2019 for our purpose. Violence is an act\nof aggression and abuse that causes or intends to cause injury, harm to persons. It also connotes\nan aggressive tendency to act out destructive behaviour. Violence can be both random as well as\ncoordinated, which includes actions carried out by sanctioned or unsanctioned violent groups.\nAggression is behaviour that is intended to cause not only harm but also pain. Aggression can be\nphysical as well as verbal. Abuse causes harm .In the context of a dalit woman it can be sexual,\nphysical and verbal. It can inflict harm to the body and can also injure feelings. An atrocity\ndescribes crimes or excesses ranging from an act committed against a single person to one\ncommitted against an ethnic group. When we are talking about violence or atrocities against\ndalit women, we have to take into consideration all these aspects.\nViolence against women is a term used to collectively refer to violent acts that are\nprimarily or exclusively committed against women. Victim\u2019s gender is the primary motive for\nthe violence. The United Nations General Assembly defines \u201cviolence against women\u201d as \u201cany\nact of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in physical, sexual or mental\nharm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of\nliberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.\nCrimes Against Women\nAlthough women may be victims of any of the general crimes such as murder, robbery,\ncheating, etc, crimes that are directed specifically against women are characterized as crimes\nagainst women.\nThese crimes are broadly classified under two categories:\n1) Crimes under the IPC like Rape (Sec 376IPC), Kidnapping and Abduction ( Sec 363-\n373IPC), Homicide for dowry, dowry deaths or their attempts ( Sec 302/304-B IPC),\nTorture- both mental and physical( Sec 498A IPC), Molestation ( Sec 354 IPC), Sexual\nHarassment ( Sec 509IPC), Importation of Girls( Sec 366B IPC)\n2) Crimes under the Special and Local Laws like Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act 1956,\nDowry Prohibition Act 1961, Child Marriage (Restraint) Act 1979, Indecent\nRepresentation of Women (Prohibition) Act 1986 and Commission of Sati(Prevention)\nAct 1987.\nNational figures from 2001 to 2005 show that the proportion of IPC crimes committed\nagainst women has increased continuously between 2001 and 2005 from 7.4% to 7.9%. in\ndifferent categories The following is the increase in different categories under the IPC.\n11\nRape 14.2%\nKidnapping and Abduction 7.5%\nTorture 18.5%\nMolestation 0.1%\nSexual harassment 2.4%\nImportation of girls 30.7%\nIndecent Rep of Women 177.3%\nIn other crimes the situation in 2005 was better than in 2001 but in the intervening years\nthe crime rates went up and down.\nDetails of the figures of crimes against women in various states in the country are given\nin Anneuxre \u2013 1.\nStatus of Dalit Women\nAccording to Ruth Manorama, an active member of the National Campaign on Dalit\nHuman Rights and the National Alliance of Women, \u201c Dalit women face a triple burden of caste,\nclass and gender.\u201d Dalit women, therefore, need to be distinguished from both \u201cwomen\u201d and\n\u201cdalits\u201d.\nAccording to Manusmriti, a brahmin, kshatriya or vaishya could sexually exploit any\nshudra woman. Even the killing of a shudra woman was justified as a minor offence for the\nbrahmins. It was equal in gravity to the killing of an animal.\nMost of the dalit girls are still dropping out of schools owing to poverty but more to\nescape humiliation, bullying and isolation by classmates, society and even the teachers. There is\nstill the danger of molestation if the school is some distance away from the dalit habitation\nwhich itself is far outside the main village.\nAccording to the Ministry of Labour, 85% of the dalit women work as agricultural\nlabourers, scavengers, sweepers and disposers of human waste.\nHuman Rights Watch is on record that sexual abuse and other forms of violence against dalit\nwomen are frequently used as tools by landlords and the police to inflict \u201cpolitical \u201c lessons and\nto crush individual or collective dissent within dalit communities. They are arrested and raped in\ncustody as a means of punishing their male relatives who are hiding from the police. There is a\npattern of impunity in attacks on women. In most cases there is no investigation even, let alone\nconviction. The atrocities are much more vulgar and parading in the naked, gang rapes, eating\nhuman excreta are common. Sexual violence is even linked with debt bondage.\n12\nSituation in Rajsasthan\nCRIMES AGAINST WOMEN BELONGING TO SC/STs\nTwo major legal enactments have been made at the national level to protect the SC/STs :\n1) Protection of Civil Rights Act 1955; and\n2) SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989.\nThe PCR Act was enacted in furtherance of Art 17 of the Constitution to abolish\nuntouchability and its practice in any form. The SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act was\nbrought into force to check and deter crimes against SC/STs by persons belonging to other\ncommunities.\nCrimes against women belonging to SC/STs can be broadly categorized under two major\nheads:\n1) Under the IPC like murder, hurt, rape, kidnapping and abduction\n2) Under Special Laws like the PCR Act and SC/ST Act\nThe comparative statement for crime in year 2004, 2005 and 2006 on SC and ST is given below:\nTable: 1.1 Comparative statement for crime on S.C.\nYear 2004, 2005 and 2006 (Till December)\nS.

Under PCR Act, there was an increase of 1372.7% and under the SC/ST Act 9.2%\nbetween 2004 and 2005.\nThis trend also shows that the STs are more alert about their rights under the protection\nof Civil Rights Act than the SCs and are more organized. The country needs to do much more\nfor SCs to give them a safe life.\nThe Position of Cases under the PCR Act and SC/ ST Act in Rajasthan.\nThe Protection of Civil Rights Act is an Act for which the the Social Welfare department\nhas been made the nodal department by the State Government but the implementation of the Act\nis with the Home department, Police, Law and various judicial courts.\nAfter the SC/ST Act came into force, cases under the PCR Act are gradually declining in\nnumber. As per the directions of the state government, the district collectors have been\nauthorized to provide monetary compensation to the victims as per their wisdom. As per the\nprovisions of the scheme, the state and the central government share the burden of this\ncompensation equally.\nThe following is the position of cases pending in the courts in the Prevention of\nAtrocities Act, the SC/ST Act, the Protection of Civil Rights Act and the compensation provided\nby the Government.\nTable: 1.3 Position of Cases under the Atrocity Act\nYear Registered Chalan FIR Pending Police\ncases (1/1/07)\n2002 5465 2624 2840 1\n2003 5241 2634 2604 3\n2004 5391 2657 2723 11\n2005 4658 2289 2347 22\n2006 4877 2151 2417 309\n14\nThe position of cases in courts under the SC/ST Act, PCR Act is given below:\nTable: 1.4 Yearly position of cases in courts under the SC/ST Act, 1989\nYear Due at Registered Total Classification of justified cases Pending % of % of\nthe at the punished decision\nstarting Punishment Acquittal Other Total end of\nof the 228 year\nyear CRPC\n2000 5750 2583 8333 293 1866 243 2402 5931 13.6 29.2\n2001 5931 2496 8427 290 1326 325 1968 6459 17.9 23.4\n2002 6459 2009 8468 540 2021 677 3238 5230 21.4 38.2\n2003 5230 2097 7327 713 2030 599 3342 3985 26.8 45.6\n2004 3985 2211 6196 517 1578 269 2364 3832 24.7 38.2\n2005 3832 1972 5804 484 1682 346 2512 3292 22.3 43.3\n2006 3292 868 4160 248 645 182 1075 3085\n(upto\n30.6.06)\nTable: 1.5 Position of Cases under the PCR Act, 1955\nYear No. of cases Registered Total Punishment Acquittal Others Total Due % of\npending at\npunished\nthe starting\nof the year\n2000 9 5 14 3 5 1 9 5 37.5\n2001 5 - 5 - 2 2 4 1 -\n2002 1 - 1 - - - - 1 -\n2003 1 1 2 - - - - 2 -\n2004 2 - 2 - 1 - 1 1 -\n2005 1 1 2 - 1 - 1 1 -\n2006 1 - 1 - - - - 1 -\n15\nTable: 1.6 Cases Under SC/ST Act of Violence Against Dalit Women By Non-Dalits in the\nSpecial Courts For SC/ST (Preventing Atrocities) 2004-2005\nDistrict Year Pending No of No of No of Appeals by No of Cases\nCases under Covictions Acquittals Prosecution where\nSC/ST Act against acquittal compensation\ngiven\nPali 2004 38 6 8 1 4\n2005 43 3 10 1 2\nKota 2004 3 3 25 Nil NA\n2005 8 Nil 17 3 NA\nGanganagar 2004 3 1 8 1 Nil\n2005 50 1 33 2 Nil\nJodhpur 2004 26 3 16 22 Nil\n2005 23 2 8 1 Nil\nTonk 2004 Nil 1 6 Nil Nil\n2005 Nil 1 13 1 Nil\nTable: 1.7 Some additional Information from Tonk Distt is given below:\nYear No of FIRs by Police FIRs Ordered by Courts No of FR put up by Prosecution\n2004 25 5 14\n2005 28 12 20\nCases under IPC\nTable: 1.8 Details of amount received from Central and State Governments\nRs In Lakhs\nYear Plan Received from Amount of expenditure No. of beneficiaries\nCentral\nRule Rule 11 Publicity Rule Rule 11\nGovernment\n12(4) 12(4)\n2001-02 34.90 35.00 40.57 - - 92 -\n2002-03 34.00 19.28 48.29 - - 131 -\n2003-04 85.00 33.68 108.51 0.06 305 49\n2004-05 225.00 200.00 165.05 0.01 3.59 797 9\n2005-06 215.00 87.00 239.22 0.34 16.17 1078 150\n2006-07 250.00 Adhoc 143.78 0.02 - 647 12\nDec. 06 21.00\n16\nTable: 1.9 Progress of Distribution of Compensation in Past Years\nRs in Lakhs\nYear Scheduled Caste Scheduled Tribes Total\nBeneficiaries Expenditure Beneficiaries Expenditure Beneficiaries Expenditure\n2001-02 70 32.20 22 8.37 92 40.57\n2002-03 89 31.05 42 17.24 131 48.29\n2003-04 251 88.94 54 19.57 305 108.51\n2004-05 640 131.01 157 34.04 797 165.05\n2005-06 898 192.53 180 46.69 1078 239.22\nSources of all the Tables above: Government of Rajasthan.\nIn 2006-07 amount of Rs. 4 crores has been kept for the compensation for Scheduled\nCastes victims and about 1 crores for the Scheduled Tribes. In the financial year 2006-07 an\namount of Rs. 107.80 lakhs has been spent for 519 SC victims till December 2006 under rule\n12(4) and under rule 11 an amount of Rs. 1180 has been spent on 12 victims. A proposal for a\ntelephone helpline is under consideration. At the state level a Secretary level officer has been\nappointed as the nodal officer. A state level vigilance and monitoring committee has also been\nset up. At the district level also such committees have been established. 17 special courts have\nbeen set up in the following districts: -\n1. Jaipur\n2. Jodhpur.\n3. Udaipur\n4. Bikaner\n5. Kota\n6. Ajmer\n7. Pali\n8. Medta (Nagaur)\n9. Alwar\n10. Pratapgarh (Chittorgarh)\n11. Dausa\n12. Jhalawar\n13. Sawai Madhopur\n14. Baran\n15. Tonk\n16. Shriganganagar\n17. Bhilwara\n17\nA special public prosecutor has been appointed in them. An IG rank officer looks after\nthe atrocities against SC and ST population. Investigation in each case is done by a deputy SP\nand the case has to be challaned within a fortnight. All these cases are registered as special FIRs.\nIn 17 districts the district police headquarters have set up SC and ST cells under a deputy SP for\nmonitoring the progress.\nA look at the implementation of laws on reforms like the PCR Act and the SC/ST Act for\ndalits shows that there are many laws to bring about social equality but they have hardly made\nan impact on the mindset of the upper castes. The figures given earlier are an ample proof.\n18\nCHAPTER II\nRESEARCH METHODOLOGY\nScope of the study\nThe status of dalit women in Rajasthan is one of the worst in the country. There is no\ndoubt that violence both mental and physical has increased during the last few years but neither\nthe police not the prosecution have become sensitive to the cause of the dalit women. Various\nstudies have shown that most of the cases have ended with a final report duly accepted by the\ncourt in which the accused have been let off because the incident \u2018 never took place\u2019.\nIn absence of any objective assessment on status of Dalit women recently in Rajasthan it\nwas necessary to assess the impact of the action taken by the state government and the\nadministration to improve the status of dalit women and to prevent them from total\nmarginalization.\nStatistics show that there is a huge difference in the literacy and health indicators\nbetween the general caste women and the dalit women. It may take decades for a dalit woman to\nreach the level of general caste women.\nThe study is also going to look into the background of violence. The sheer helplessness\nin getting to police, the delay in getting justice if the hurdle of the police is crossed, the\nweaknesses of the legal procedures, the feudal mindset and the torture when asking for justice is\nalso going to the studied. Whether the fear of violence has any impact on dalit women exercising\ntheir social, economic and political rights will also be examined.\nObjectives of the study\n1. Study of the physical and social atrocities on dalit women\n2. Study of the types of atrocities on dalit women\n3. The role of the society and the government in preventing the atrocity\n4. Do the exertions of rights of dalit women on their lands cause them more trouble-\npolitically, socially and economically.\n5. Difficulties faced by dalit women in getting justice\n19\nResearch Design and the Methodology of the study\nAnalysis of the situation of dalit women is a very sensitive subject. Therefore, we have\nadopted a participatory procedure for research. Before the study was started a meeting was\norganized with various academic institutions, voluntary organizations and individuals working\non violence against women and violation of human rights of dalits. The meeting was attended by\nsocial workers, lawyers, college teachers, journalists and representatives of the all India\n\u2018Janwadi Mahila Samiti\u2019. The basic purpose of the meeting was\n(a) to decide a definition of the word \u2018dalit\u2019 for the study so that it could be clear as to\nwhich category of women have to be studied for finding the different problems faced by them.\n(b) to decide the methodology of research and to define the type of cases of violence to\nbe studied.\nOn (a), the group felt that as the worst kind of violence amongst the dalits is faced by\nthe \u2018untouchable\u2019 women, we should generally include the cases of violence against the\nuntouchable dalit women. However if there are serious cases of violence against other dalit\nwomen, they may also be studied.\nOn (b), it was decided to use the existing secondary data and to use interviews and\nthe case study method.\nAs it was not possible to cover the cases of atrocities throughout the state and to include\nall the 32 districts, it was decided to take up six districts and to select 15 cases of violence\nagainst dalit women in each district.\nThe selection of the districts was done on the basis of dalit population in the districts,\ntheir geographical dispersal in the state and the number of registered cases of violence against\ndalit women for the last five years. After using the criteria decided for selection, the following\nsix districts were identified:\n1. Sriganganagar 4. Kota\n2. Jodhpur 5. Bharatpur\n3. Pali 6. Tonk\nTable: 2.1 Population of SCs in the Selected Districts\nS.N. District Total Population Percentage of SC\nPopulation\n1 Sriganganagar 1,788487 33.7\n2. Bharatpur 2101142 21.7\n3. Jodhpur 2886505 15.8\n4. Pali 1819201 17.8\n5. Tonk 1211671 19.2\n6. Kota 1568525 19.2\n20\nGeographical Distribution in the State\nPali, Jodhpur and Ganganagar as are in western Rajasthan in the desert zone;\nBharatpur and Kota are in the eastern Rajasthan which is agriculture based; and\nTonk is in central Rajasthan which is predominantly an SC district near Jaipur, the capital of the\nstate.\nNo district was selected from southern Rajasthan because it has high tribal population and there\nare not many scheduled castes.\nTools and Methods of Data Collection\nThe study has gathered data from the various sources like newspaper reports, magazines,\nreports of other governmental and non governmental agencies addressing these issues of\nviolence against the dalits etc.\nIt was decided to prepare a profile of each district which would contain demographic,\ngeographic, economic, social, historical and religious features. It would also be explored\nwhether some of more gruesome cases of violence against dalit women could be collected. It\nwas also decided to request the police department to provide 15 representative cases of violence\nagainst the dalit women in each selected district since the year 2001 to 2005 and a case study of\nthose cases was conducted. The case studies would be a source of qualitiative information and\nwas expected to impart an insight in to the issue to violence against dalit women. Cases were\nalso collected of rape, sexual exploitation and murder which involved influential people and\nwhich had taken place only to satisfy their ego.\nSome cases in which F.R.s had been put up by the police leading to the acquittal of the\naccused, were also to be studied.\nIt was also decided to hold interviews in each district with government officers, lawyers,\njudges, public prosecuters, women public representatives, voluntary organizations and human\nrights organizations to find their views on the subject.\nProper tools and methods were designed for these consultations. These consultations\nwere based on questionnaires and guidelines for interviews. The Interview Guide was drafted on\nthe basis of major variables, parameters and objectives of the study.\nData Processing\nThe interview guidelines were to be edited, codified and tabulated.

In the\nVedic age Maharsi Javali stayed in this area for meditation and interpretation of Vedas. The\nPandavas in the Mahabharata age also have made this area (near Bali) their resting place during\nthe exile. As a part of ancient Arbuda Province, this area was known as Balla-Desh.\nHistorical relics depict the existence of this area during the Kushana Age, when King\nKannishka had conquered Rohat and Jaitaran area, parts of today's Pali district, in 120 AD. Till\nthe end of seventh century A. D. , this area was reigned by the Chalukya King Harshavardhana\nwho also conquered Bhinmal and most of the present area of Rajasthan.\n16th and 17th century saw a number of battles in the surrounding areas of Pali. Shershah\nsuri was defeated by Rajput rulers in the battle of Gini, Mughal emperor Akbar's army had\nconstant battles with Maharana Pratap in Godwad area. Again after the Mughals had conquered\nalmost all of Rajputana, Veer Durga Das Rathore of Marwar made organized efforts to redeem\nthe Marwar area from Aurangzeb, the last Mughal emperor. By then Pali had become\nsubservient to Rathores of Marwar state. Pali was rehabilitated by Maharaja Vijay Singh and\nsoon it became an important commercial center.\nRole in struggle for freedom: Under British rule pali played an important role by\npioneering the freedom struggle in Marwar. Various Thakurs of pali under the stewardship of\nThakur of Auwa, who was the most powerful of all, confronted with the British rule. Auwa fort\nwas surrounded by the British army and then confilcts lasted by 5 days, when at last the fort was\npossessed by the British army. But this heroie action of Auwa paved the way for continued and\norganised struggle for freedom.\nThe Great Aravali hills link Pali district with Ajmer, Rajsamand, Udaipur and Sirohi\nDistricts. Western Rajasthan's famous river Luni and its tributaries Jawai, Mithadi, Sukadi,\nBandi and Guhiabala flows through Pali district. The Largest dams of this area Jawai Dam and\nSardar Samand Dam are also located in Pali district. While plains of this district are 180 to 500\nmeters above sea level, Pali city the district headquarter, is situated at 212 meters above sea\nlevel. While the highest point of Aravali hills in the district measures 1099 meters, the famous\n30\nRanakpur temples are situated in the foot steps of Aravalis . Parashuram Mahadev temple, a\nplace of worship for millions of devotees of Lord Shiva, is also located in the Pali district on the\nhights of aravali range.\nGeographical Condition\nClimate & Rainfall: The climatic conditions of Pali district are some what different than\nthe Western Rajasthan. Although, basically the summer season raise the temperature upto 46-47\ndegree centigrade at peak Time in May-June , a large variation in temperature is found due to\nadjoining green and hilly areas. Winters are moderately cool during December-Janruary\nlowering the mercury to 4-5 degree centigrade occasionally. Average rainfall in the district\nduring the months of July-October is 300 mm.\nAgricultural activities of Pali district are mostly dependent on monsoon. Although\ndistrict has a lot of irrigation dams, ponds etc. but Still more then 50% of farmers are\ndependent on monsoon. Most of the farmers obtain two crops i.e. Kharif and Rabi. Rabi crops\nare usually sown in November whereas Kharif crops are sown with the begining of the first\nrains in July. Kharif crops includes Bajara, Jowar, Moong, Rice, Groundnut, Red Chillies etc.\nThe district like many others suffers from poor literacy rates for dalit women. There is\nwidespread untouchability and dalits are denied access to temples. They are given tea in earthen\ncups in dhabas and no dalit bridegroom is allowed to ride a horse on his marriage.\nAt one of the Independence Day functions, the entire dalit community of Sivas village\nwas ostracized by the village panchayat because some dalit boys served water from a public\nhand pump at the school function\nThe percentage of SCs in Pali is high at 22.63% and the largest group is of Chamars. The\nother groups are Meghwal, Sargava, Bawaria and Koli.\n1. Dalit woman Sarpanch Samu Devi, Age 56 years.\nIt is a case of 1999. When the meeting of the Panchayat started some upper caste persons\ncame and started drinking and abusing the Sarpanch. They also beat up the other participants in\nthe meeting and gave them caste based abuses. The victim registered a case under section 3 of\nthe SC/ST Act. The entire panchayat was witness to these caste based abuses. The case was\nregistered by the police which helped the Sarpanch in fighting the case but was ultimately\ncompromised because there was tremendous family and social pressure not to pursue the case\nagainst fellow villagers.. There are hardly 100 houses of the dalits out of six hundred in the\nvillage.\n31\nJats and Brahmins are extremely powerful in the village. There is widespread\nuntouchability at public places and at sources of water.\n2. Smt Manju Devi\nThe incident is of 26 July 2006. The victim had obtained the work of cooking meals in\nthe local school. The villagers did not like the idea that a dalit should makethe meals for their\nchildren. A conspiracy was therefore hatched to file a case of theft against her husband, and then\nshe was removed from her work. She was pregnant at that time.\nThe police did not register the case under the SC/ST Act. A complaint was therefore\nlodged in the court and so the case has now been registered. The case is still pending.\nThe victim was supported by only a few in the society. The village is dominated by\nBrahmins. Out of 450 households only 180 are of dalits.\n3. Smt Teepu. 38 years. FIR 27/2004\nOn 1st April 2004 the victim was coming by bus with her two children when she was\npulled out of the bus by some upper caste people who called her by caste names and beat her up.\nThe police registered a case u/s 323, 241 IPC and Sec 3(1)(X) SC/ST Act which is pending. The\npolice has helped her in the case and has investigated it with fainess.A govt advocate is fighting\nthe case for her.\nShe has been supported by her family, in spite of the fact that she has been threatened by\nthe accused.\nPurohit Brahmins are very powerful in the village. Out of 600 households 200 belong to\ndalits.\n4. Smt Parvati Devi Harijan. Age 55 years.\nIt is a case of a dalit woman who is a scavenger but fought for her rights and won them.\nThe incident is of 2001. The director of a village private school got the tender of scavenging of\nthe panchayat but employed people from another village. This adversely affected the\nemployment of the local people. When it was opposed by the victim with others she was badly\nabused with caste names and threatened with dire consequences. But she kept her fight on and\nultimately prevailed upon the accused to give up the contract.\n5. Smt Nenu Meghwal. Age 30 years.

He fortified the city by building a\nmassive wall around the city.\nThe interesting aspect of the Bharatpur history is the domination of Jats in the\nregion since 17th century.

So the Rathore's belong to the Suryavansha. (solar race) Later, breaking into\nhistorical reality, in 470 A.D. Nayal Pal conquered the kingdom of Kanauj. The Rathor capital\nfor seven centuries, Kanauj fell in 1193 to the Afghan invader's led by Muhammad Ghori.\nThe fleeing ruler, Jai Chand was drowned in the Ganga. But his son Siyaji, had better\nluck. An expedient marriage alliance between the Rathore Sihaji and the sister of a local prince\nenabled the Rathors to consolidate themselves in this region. In fact, they prospered to such a\ndegree that they managed to oust the Pratiharas of Mandore. He later set himself up as an\nindependent ruler around the wealthy trading centre of Pali. In 1381 Rao Chanda ousted the\nParihars from Mandore which then became the Rathore seat of government. Rao Chanda's son\nand heir, Rainmal, won praise for his capture of Ajmer and was then entrusted with the care of\nhis orphaned nephew, destined to inherit the Mewar throne of Chittor. In 1438 he was doped\nwith opium, and finally shot dead. This triggered bitter feuds, ending with Mewar and Marwar\nbecoming separate states.\nBy 1459, it became evident that a more secure headquarters was required. The high\nrocky ridge nine km to the south of Mandore was an obvious choice for the new city of Jodhpur.\nRao Ganga Singh of Jodhpur (reigned 1516-32) fought alongside the army of the great\nwarrior king of Mewar, Rana Sanga, against the first Mughal emperor, Babur.\nBut over the next half century, the rulers of Jodhpur allied themselves with Babur's\ngrandson, Akbar. With the support of the Mughals, the court of Jodhpur flourished and the\nkingdom became a great centre of the arts and culture. In the 17th century Jodhpur became a\nflourishing centre of trade for the camel caravans moving from Central Asia to the parts of\nGujarat and vice versa.\nPolitical Strife: The kingdom of Jodhpur then formed a triple alliance with Udaipur and\nJaipur, which together threw off the Mughal yoke.\nIn the 1870's, Pratap Singh a son of Maharaja of Jodhpur, which he ruled, in effect, for\nnearly fifty years. Sir Pratap Singh laid the foundation of a modern state in Jodhpur, which\nMaharaja Umaid Singh (reigned 1918-47) built upon. The kingdom of Jodhpur was not merely\nthe largest of the Rajput states, but also one of the most progressive.\nIn 1949, after the independence of India, it was merged into the newly created state of\nRajasthan.\n43\nGeography\nJodhpur, one of the largest district of Rajasthan state is centrally situated in Western\nregion of the State, having geographical area of 22850 sq.

The astrologers decided that if the fort is to\nbe built it can be done only if a human is sacrificed to the Goddess. Promptly, a dalit Raja Ram\nMeghwal was produced and sacrificed.\nThe largest population of SCs in Jodhpur district is in Jodhpur tehsil followed by Bilada,\nOsian, Phalodi, and Shergarh.

Victims are from the Kanjar, Sansi, nat, and bavariya castes. It is presumed that\nthe women of these castes are sex workers although most of them are not now. On the basis of\nthis presumption, these women are constantly exploited sexually by the upper castes. When the\nvictim approaches the police they are sent back on the plea that they are otherwise also sex\nworkers.\nThe poorest sub caste among dalits in Tonk are the Valmikis. They seldom send their\nchildren, especially girls to school. They have their own hand pumps to fetch water because no\none allows them to touch theirs. They are basically scavengers and also keep pigs. They still\ntake left over food from the upper castes and eat it.\nIn the schools, there is a clear divide between upper caste and dalit children. The upper\ncaste teachers are visibly supporting the upper caste children.\nThe upper caste girls sit in front rows. A number of dalit girls leave schools because they\nare teased on caste-based names. It is obvious that schools have not made any sincere efforts to\nerase the caste lines. The dalit children are made to realize every day by some incident or the\nother that they are different and are at a lower strata than the upper castes.\nGenerally, the schools are also nearer the upper caste population and away from the dalit\nbastis.\nThe Berwas consider themselves superior to Raigars, Nayaks and Valmikis and do not\nmingle socially with them.\nIn the same village, each SC subcaste lives in different portions which can be easily\ndemarcated.\nThe largest group among the SCs in Tonk is the Chamar who form nearly 30% of the\ntotal population of SCs in the district. They work as tanners, day labourers, village menials and\nagriculturists. Other castes include Khatik, Koli, Bhangi and Balai. They all permit marriage of\n60\nwidows as Nata. Polygamy marriages are still seen amongst Jats, Gurjar, Meena, Daroga,\nBhambi, Dhakar, Mali, Chamar, Raigar and other SCs.\nCases from Tonk\nS.N.

There is wide spread untouchability and discrimination\nagainst dalits at public places and water sources.\n14. Case of \u2018Daakan\u2019\nA 70-year old widow called Rajee Devi has been the victim. She sweeps the village. The\nGurjars Khateeks and Meenas are powerful people in the village. One day 5-6 persons come in a\ntractor, called her a Daakan and took her to another village. Beat her badly so that she was in\nbed for six months. Since then the woman is mentally deranged.\nThe police did not register the case for a long time. When it was registered, the section\nunder SC/ST Act were not included. There is no progress in the matter. The public prosecutor\nalso did not take any interest in the case, which is still going on.

Her younger children have also been taken away\nby her father in law who alleges that she is a characterless woman. She has to go hungry on\nmany days.\n70\nIssues emerging out:\n\u2022 The upper castes are constantly opposing and pressurizing the dalit family.\n\u2022 The poorest caste among dalits in Tonk are the Valmikis\n\u2022 The dalit girls have to leave school because they are teased on caste based\nnames\n\u2022 Upper castes are \u2013 Gurjar, Jats, Brahmins, Baniyas\n\u2022 The dalit women are castigated as sex workers\n\u2022 The upper caste always interferes with the work of dalit elected\nrepresentatives.\n\u2022 The dalits cannot enter temples and the dalit Panchas are not allowed to sit\non chairs\n71\nKOTA\nHistory\nThe history of the city dates back to the 12th century A.D. when the Hada Chieftain, Rao\nDeva, conquered the territory and founded Bundi and Hadoti. Later, in the early 17th century\nAD during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir, the ruler of Bundi -Rao Ratan Singh, gave\nthe smaller principality of Kota to his son, Madho Singh. Since then Kota became a hallmark of\nthe Rajput gallantry and culture.\nThe south eastern region of Rajasthan known as Hadoti comprises of Bundi, Baran,\nJhalawar and Kota. Prehistoric caves,paintings,formidable forts and the mighty chambal river\nhurtling from the Vindhyas are dotted in the region. When Jait Singh of Bundi defeated the Bhil\nChieftain Koteya in a battle, he raised the first battlement or the 'Garh'(fort) over his severead\nhead. The Independant state of Kota became a reality in 1631 when Rao Madho Singh, the\nsecond son of Rao Ratan of Bundi was made the ruler, by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan.\nSoon Kota outgrew its parent state to become bigger in area, richer in revenue and more\npowerful. Maharao Bhim Singh played a pivotal role in Kota's history, having held a 'Mansab' of\nfive thousand and being the first in his dynasty to have the title of Maharao. Kota is situated on\nthe banks of chambal river and is fastly emerging as an important industrial centre. It boasts of\nAsia's largest fertilizer plant, precision instrument unit and atomic power station nearby.\nSurprisingly unexplored, the Kota region of Rajasthan has some splendid treasures for the tourist\nto take home memories of. Its impregnable fortresses, sprawling palaces, exquisitely wrought\npalaces and lovely waterways act as a magnificient foil to its exotic wildlife and delicate fresco\nPaintings.\nSituated on the banks of the Chambal River,at an important juncture of the trade route\nbetween Delhi and Gujrat, Kota is Rjasthan's Fifth Largest City. This Bustling,sprawling city is\nalso called the industrial capital of the state. The tentacles of the modern world have the city in\nits grip with the Chambal Valley Project giving it a major position on the state's industrial map.\nChemicals,fertilizers, synthetic fibres, tyrecord and sophisticated instruments, industry's\nmainstay, have helped in pushing this ancient city into the forefront of modernisation. Yet\nmemories of its ancient links linger strongly. Present Day Kota owes its foundations to a Kotya\nBhil warrior who 800 years ago built a small fortification at akelgarh and put up a protective\nmud-wall around it all the way to Retwali. In 1580, Rao Madho Singh strenghtened both the\nfortification and the wall. In time to come, Kota acquired the Hallmark of rajput power as well\nas culture.\n72\nTable: 4.10\nPOPULATION\nSrNo Head Unit Reference Year Details\n1. Rural No. 2001 729948\n2.

Kota is a stronghold of hindutva forces and there is a\ncontant communal tension. Lately, the Christians have faced the wrath of the Hindutva elements.\nThe communal forces are also using the dalits for increasing communal tensions by inciting\nthem on religious grounds or paying them money. Owing to the constant humiliation faced by\nthem, a number of dalit families got converted into Christianity.\nKota was a very prosperous industrial town till some time back. A large number of dalits\nwere employed in the factories. Now most of the industries are sick and there has been a massive\nloss of jobs, the brunt falling on the dalits. Most of the harijan women are still carrying night soil\nin the poorer area of the Kota town.\nThe Ladpur tehsil has the largest number of SC persons and Shahbad the least in Kota\ndistrict Chamar, Bhambi, Jatav, Jatia, Mochi, Raidas, Raigr form the largest single group\namongst the SCs followed by Balai, Koli, Nehar, Meghwal and others.

It is because a number of persons in the area have come from\n82\nPunjab and before that from West Pakistan at the time of partition. The caste barriers are,\ntherefore, less.Number of STs is quite insignificant. Amongst the SCs, Meghwals who used to\nskin animals are an important part of SCs.

Interviews were held in all the six selected districts\nwith the Collectors. S.Ps, District and Sessions Judges, Public Prosecutors and some other\nofficials, especially women officers. Interviews were also held with women public\nrepresentatives, teachers, lawyers, NGOs, journalists, dalit activists etc. The interviews were\nheld on the basis of prepared Questionnaires\nOn many questions, it was found that the views of the administrators, police, judiciary\nand public prosecutors were totally different from those of NGOs, academicians and dalits. The\nmain differences were on the SC/ST Act and cases registered under it, the role of the two- police\nand the public prosecutor and the so-called caste based discrimination against dalit women.\nMost of the administrators, police officers and judicial officers were of the view that SC/ST Act\nwas a very highly misused Act. They also said that\na) Most of the dalits register false cases under the Act\nb) As under the Act there is a provision of monetary compensation under serious offences,\ndalits register false cases to get the compensation.\nc) Most of the final reports are given because the cases are false and not because they are\nnot investigated honestly.\nd) There are mostly compromises and the cases are taken back or the witnesses become\nhostile.\ne) Contrary to the presumption, police takes cases under this Act very seriously and it is\nunder constant pressure to challan the cases even if there is no force in them. It is\nbecause of this reason that the accused are acquitted.\nf) As per the police, in cases under the Act, independent witnesses should be from the\nupper castes, which seldom happens.\nMany dalit activists, representatives of NGOs and independent persons accepted that an\nSC woman is far weaker than an upper caste woman and, therefore, faces much more atrocity.\nThe reasons are:\n(a) As a dalit woman has to be out of her home much more than an upper caste woman\nto meet the daily needs of food for the family, there is less control of the men in dalit\nhouseholds. The women have to become outspoken to otherwise they would be\ncrushed. Their attitude is not liked by the upper castes who find it easy to attack their\n92\ncharacter. When there is sexual exploitation they are always accused as characterless\nwomen\n(b) As violence against women in general has increased, the SC women also face much\nmore violence now.\n(c) Most of the SC men are landless and poverty ridden. They migrate leaving their\nwomen alone. These women then fall a prey to the violence by the upper castes.\n(d) If there is violence against an SC woman, all the upper castes unite against her.Under\nfear there is no unity even within the scheduled castes to help the SC victim.\nMost of the police officers, district collectors, district judges and public prosecutors in the six\ndistricts believed that there was no caste-based violence against dalit women. Some NGOs also\nthought so. Although it was accepted by everybody that most of the women from the scheduled\ncastes were addressed by other castes as chamar, bhangi, balai, etc, in a very derogatory manner;\nno offence was meant and, therefore, it was not necessary to register such cases.\n93\nCHAPTER V\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt was generally accepted that untouchability was still prevailing. There are separate\nutensils for scheduled caste clients in the restaurants/ dhabas, if ever touched by a dalit the\nhigher castes take a bath. If there is a harijan marriage most of the upper caste owners of hotels\nand restaurants close their establishments. Most of the women agricultural labourers are raped or\nsexually exploited. Most of the dalit women are considered to be witches. They are never paid\ntheir full wages. In the ICDS also most upper caste government officials do not touch the food\nprepared by a dalit woman in the anganbari or stay at her house. This mental attitude was found\nto be prevalent widely.\nThe alleged discrimination against dalit women was just shrugged off by most of the\ninvitees.\nQuite different from these views were the observations of our investigators who talked to\nthe victims and the villagers. They felt that there was widespread caste based violence against\ndalit women in the districts. The victims are generally the agricultural labourers working in the\nfield of upper caste owners. They were widely discriminated in public places and also at sources\nof drinking water. There is also sexual exploitation, rapes and gang rapes. The affluent and\npowerful men of upper castes humiliate dalit women, talk in derogatory language to them as\nwell as call them by caste names. Most of these powerful castes do not bother about women who\nhave been victimized by them. A woman who his raped is generally called a \u2018Kulta\u2019 \u2013\ncharacterless.\nAfter the rapes most of the influential persons say that it was consensual sex. The\nvictimized woman is so disturbed mentally and also financially that she cannot resist for long.\nOn the question of the role of the police and administration in providing justice to these women\nvictims of violence, it was said that the district administration was indifferent and non-\ncooperative. As the women are not even supported by the dalit societies, they are left alone and\nwithout the knowledge of law and their human rights, they feel helpless. It was also felt that\nviolence against dalit women had been constantly increasing although a large number of cases\nwere not reported. The number of cases in which dalit women work as bonded labour has also\nincreased. Most of the women listed as agricultural labour are bonded and do not receive any\nregular wages. Abduction and kidnapping, continuous sexual exploitation and rape have gone up\nin the districts.\n94\nAlong with the executive, the judiciary has also not played a powerful role in providing\njustice to these women. The police and judicial proceedings are so complicated that most of the\ndalit women have lost confidence even in the judiciary. They cannot fight the general feeling\nthat most of the women lodged false complaints and are interested only in monetary\ncompensation and their cases are also due to personal animosity between the family of the\nvictim and the accused family.\nNot much has been done to raise the awareness level of the dalits. Most of the dalits do\nnot own lands and as agriculture is the only occupation in the districts, they are left with no job\nbut to work as agricultural labourer or as a labour in the brick kilns.\nThe dalits are also not socially united. They are constantly fighting against each other.\nHistorically, the dalits have been the weakest strata of the society In Sriganganagar, after the\ncanal waters they have been exploited by rich and powerful landowners and castes like Jats and\nSikhs. The dalits have never come together to fight this exploitation. The only caste which got\nunited was the meghwals who boycotted the lifting of dead animals which was their traditional\noccupation. In order to raise the status of dalit women in the districts it is important that their\nliteracy levels should be raised. They should also be told about the various laws especially the\nSC/ST Act. It is important that their self-esteem should be raised. There should be more and\nmore opportunities for employment. The accused should also be given exemplary punishment. It\nis also necessary that social customs and religious superstitions should be got rid of. It is\nnecessary that the \u2018Purdah\u2019 system should be abolished. Residential schools are necessary for\nproviding education to these women.\nDalit Women Worse than Devdasis\nYou can tell the \"servants of God\" from the other Dalit women outside the Hindu\ntemple by their jewelry. They're wearing red beaded necklaces with silver and gold\nmedallions. The necklaces symbolize the bondage that defines devadasi girls from the lowest\ncaste whose parents have given them to local goddesses or temples as human \"offerings.\"\nMarried to God before puberty, the devadasis, many of whom live in the temples, become\nsexual servants to the villages' upper-caste men after their first menstrual period. In some\nvillages, devadasis are kept as concubines by the men who bought them. In others they are\npublic chattel, who can be used by men free of charge. \"Only in this aspect do Untouchables\nsuddenly become touchable \"The upper castes wouldn't drink from the same glass as a\ndevadasi -- but they make use of her body. Short of being called devdasis, a large number of\nuntouchable girls in Rajasthan face the same fate. Instead of living in temples and serving the\n95\npriests and their guests, they are waylaid in fields and sexually exploited without any fear by\nthe powerful castes in the villages, which could be even some scheduled tribes.\nLand rights of dalits\nRecently there was a public hearing on the rights of dalits on their lands by the Dalit\nRights Centre, Rajasthan and other agencies. A number of cases of dalit women whose rights on\ntheir lands had been encroached came up for hearing. Some of them are reported below: -\n1. A village called Jawad, only 42 km from the capital of the state, has influential Jats and\nRajputs and the scheduled caste families have to live far outside the main village. These\ninfluential castes have grabbed most of the land including some belonging to the dalits\nalso. One such land, which legally belongs to a dalit widow, was grabbed by the upper\ncastes on the plea that it was a temple land. Although the widow has now won the case\nfrom a lower court and got a stay in her favour but she is under constant threat from\nupper castes. She has small children and feels very insecure. Her application for binding\nthe upper caste persons u/s 107, 151 CrPC has been filed away by the police. The widow\nhas still not been able to use the land as the matter has been pending for a long time in\nthe Board of Revenue.\n2. In another case of a widow in village Rajoli, district Dausa, the land was forcibly\noccupied by the local land mafia\u2019s leader who forcibly constructed a boundary wall, In\nspite of a court stay the construction work has gone on and this land has been falsely\nregistered under the name of his wife. The poor widow has been writing several petitions\nto various officials but to no avail. The encroacher has stopped the right of way for the\nwidow even for the little piece of land left for her.\n3. In Dausa district, which was a part of Jaipur district earlier, the husband of a raigar had\nbeen beaten up so badly for a piece of land belonging to him that he succumbed to his\ninjuries and died. Case was registered but the police favoured the accused and acquitted\nthem. As a result of his death, his daughter also died of shock. The widow and her\nchildren are under constant threat of death by those who are now out of jail.\n4. A meghwal widow belonging to district Pali, owns land of around ten Bhigas but her\nneighbor who has a lime mine first extended the mine upto her field and then encroached\nupon it. He dug a mine in her field. When she resisted he promised some monetary\ncompensation which has not been paid so far. Although the police registered a case under\nIPC against the encroacher and the department of mines has been told to cancel the mine\n96\nlease of the encroacher, he has been out on bail and the mines department has also not\ncancelled his lease, with the result that the poor widow is finding it difficult to survive.\n5. In a case of rape of a dalit minor girl, the rapists who were Rajputs got so annoyed with\nthe uncle of the victim for his interference that they beat him up so badly that he died\nafter 2 days. They also influenced the local doctor who declared that the death of the\nuncle was from T.B. and not from beating. As this was too much to accept, a local NGO\nand the other villagers got together and the police had to register a case of murder.\nUltimately, after 3 years the two accused have been punished with life imprisonment.\nSome Other Cases of Atrocities\n1. The case of a dalit woman magistrate is quite shocking. When she refused to be sexually\nexploited by a fellow officer, he started assassinating her character. When she complained to the\ndistrict judge the officer had to apologise but he decided to take revenge. He continued to\ninstigate lawyers against her and told them that she was not getting married because she was\ncharacterless. He kept on troubling her even when she did get married. Not only was she\nhumiliated in front of the staff but also false charges were leveled against her and she had to\nkeep on giving explanations about the alleged charges against her. She has been suspended by\nthe High Court although she is a very upright officer.\n2. In a case of violence in Bharatpur, a woman\u2019s right leg was cut off by a gurjar, just to let\noff his anger against her son. For a long time the culprit was not arrested as he was an influential\nperson in the village.\n3. There is a wide spread practice of calling a woman \u2018Dayan\u2019 or a \u2018Dakan\u2019 and then\ngrabbing her land by the upper castes. Even in a prosperous district like Bhilwara, in 2004, more\nthan a dozen women were harassed and beaten up badly and called \u2018Dayans\u2019. Two of them were\nkilled also but the police did not take any action. On the other hand, they sent away the\ncomplainants by calling them liars.\nThe most vulnerable is the single, divorced, widow who is poor and is from a dalit caste.\nBy calling her a \u2018Dayan\u2019 and constantly telling her family also that she is a \u2018Dayan\u2019 and\nostracizing her from the society they convince the family members also who start hating her.\nThe result is that the woman becomes so weak that she is helpless when her land is being\ngrabbed and she either lives in the village in utter poverty or goes away from the village.\nIn an incident on 13th November 2004, a 55-year old dalit balai woman was called to the\nvillage chaupal by the upper caste Gurjars and was declared a \u2018dayan\u2019 on the allegation that she\nwas eating one of the Gurjars slowly for the last 13 years. As a result he was growing weaker\n97\nand weaker. The Bhopas also conspired with the upper castes and pronounced the woman a\nDakan. It was decided to cut up the poor woman into pieces and to throw the remains away. She\nwas badly beaten up and dragged around and was about to be burnt alive when some persons\nintervened and she was let off with a warning that she should not be seen in the village again.\nIn Tonk, a 70-year old woman was beaten up badly with the allegation that she was a\nDayan in 2005.\nA Threat Lies at Every Corner\nIn February 2004, a dalit woman was raped by a police constable in Jaipur. In March, all\nthe clothes of a woman were taken off and she was humiliated in Udaipur. In April, in Churu, a\nwoman was gang raped. In June, again in Jaipur, an attempt was made to rape a harijan woman.\nWhen she resisted she was injured with a knife. In Bhilwara, another dalit was raped in June. In\nJuly, in order to forcibly occupy her land a dalit woman was badly beaten up. In Dholpur, a dalit\nwoman was paraded naked. This act was repeated in Alwar in August with a dalit woman and\nher mother. The victim\u2019s sin was that she had fallen in love with a man of a different caste. In\nJalore, two dalit women were raped in a government house. In November, the influential upper\ncastes did not leave even a woman Sarpanch and she was sexually exploited. She was also called\na \u2018Dakan\u2019 and harassed. In March 2005, in Mehndipur ke Balaji, a 13-year-old minor was not\nonly raped but also murdered. Another old dalit woman in Tonk was beaten up. These incidents\ngo on happening in various parts of the state but no body is perturbed about it. There is a general\nbelief that you may not touch a dalit woman but can rape her whenever you have the desire to do\nso.\nDiscrimination and Sexual Exploitation at Work Place\nGudma Devi of Barmer has been trying for months to get justice but owing to political\npressure has not succeeded. She is a 36 years old widow and is the only breadwinner for\nher family. She is a Meghwal and is working in an NGO. She went on an inspection to a nearby\nvillage school to look at their mid-day meal programme. When she wanted to share their meal,\nthe children refused to eat with her because she was a dalit and their teacher had told them not to\neat with a meghwal. When she asked the teacher concerned, he started abusing her, caught her\nhair and threw her down and started insulting her. He told her that he would sleep with her if she\nwants but not eat. Two other men started abusing her too. She was threatened not to repeat what\nshe attempted that morning. When she went to her organization\u2019s office, the upper caste vishnois\ndid not leave her there also. She was threatened with death. She remained in the office for the\nnight and went to the police station in the morning. Instead of lodging her complaint, the police\n98\nabused her and threw her out. Even the S.P. did not help her. Whenever she approached the\npolice she was advised to run away, otherwise she would be beaten up by the upper castes.. She\nis mentally so upset that she is always scared that she might be killed and then what would\nhappen to her three small children.\nThere is widespread discrimination on famine relief works also. When a dalit activist\nwoman went to a famine relief work at a village pond, she found that women who were giving\ndrinking water to the labourers were not allowing the tribal and dalit women to touch her\ncontainer. They were pouring water to them from a very high point with the result that half the\nwater was being wasted. Most of the dalit women found it very humiliating and although thirsty\ndid not drink water. The water for dalits was brought from the container kept for animals.\nThe dalit women on the site were not even asked to donate money for the prasad at the\ntemple. But were forced to clean up the land outside the temple site. When the matter was\nreported to the media, the enquiry that was ordered was headed by an officer of the same caste,\nGurjar, which had committed the discrimination with the result that nothing came out of the\nenquiry. On top of it, the village is now socially boycotting all the dalits.\nIn a case in Bhilwara, a dalit lady constable was sexually exploited by her officer. It\nseems that the enquiry is still incomplete after several years.\nDenial of property\nA denial of the rightful property to a dalit woman after beating her up and scaring her\naway has become a normal practice by the upper castes.\nIn Barmer, a panchayat sanctioned the loan for a small house under the Indira Awas\nYojna to a dalit woman a few years ago. She was promised the first instalment of the\nconstruction money after she filled up the foundation of the house. She took a loan of Rs. 10,000\nat 24% interest per annum from a private merchant for the foundation and went to the gram\nsewak and Sarpanch after completing the foundation work. They did not give her the promised\ninstalment. When the matter was reported to the district collector, the Sarpanch started\nthreatening her and instead of helping her the allotment itself was cancelled.\nIn Bhatni a woman had purchased a piece of land that was forcibly occupied by the\ninfluential upper castes. They beat her up whenever she demanded her land back. She is under\nconstant threat.\nAnother common practice of locating hand pumps and sources of drinking water in a\nvillage is that the influential upper castes are always able to get the tubewells and handpumps\ninstalled in their own localities and prevent dalit women from taking water from there. The\nwater for the dalit homes is, therefore, mostly taken from old ponds and wells.\n99\nWhenever there is a shortage of water in the village and dalit women approach the new\nwells, they are always abused and many a time beaten up.\nMental and physical violence against dalit women and dalit Panchas\nThe dalit women Panchas and Sarpanchas who come through the electoral processes are\nstill discriminated against, after 15 years and 3 elections under the new Act coming into force..\nThey are always pressurized by the upper caste members to do the work at their command. A\nnumber of them have complained that they are not allowed to sit on the chairs in the meetings.\nOne of them was not even allowed to enter the panchayat room. In another village, where a dalit\nwoman is the sarpanch, the ward panchas from the upper castes do not attend the meetings\ncalled by the Sarpanch.\nLaws for the Protection of Dalits\nThe study of the cases of violence in the eight districts both registered and unregistered\nby the police, focused group discussions, interviews with villagers, officials, lawyers, public\nprosecutors and the district level judiciary have brought out very clearly that the enforcement\nof laws designed to protect Dalits is lax, if not non-existent in Rajasthan. The machinery\nconsisting of commissions like the SC/ST Commission, the Human Rights Commission, etc\nhave not been able to achieve the goals. The practice of untouchability is strongest in rural\nareas, where 80 percent of the country's population resides. There, the underlying religious\nprinciples of Hinduism dominate.\nAlthough illegal, most of the Dalits are bonded workers, many working to pay off debts\nthat were incurred generations ago for religious ceremonies like mrityu-bhoj. These people, a\nlarge number of whom are children, especially girls, work under slave-like conditions hauling\nrocks, or working in fields or factories\nDalit women are particularly hard hit. They are frequently raped or beaten as a means of\nreprisal against male relatives who are thought to have committed some act worthy of upper-\ncaste vengeance. They are also subject to arrest if they have male relatives hiding from the\nauthorities.\nA report released by Amnesty International in 2001 found an \"extremely high\" number\nof sexual assaults on Dalit women, frequently perpetrated by landlords, upper-caste villagers,\nand police officers. The study estimates that only about 5 percent of attacks are registered, and\nthat police officers dismissed at least 30 percent of rape complaints as false.\n100\nThe study also found that the police routinely demand bribes, intimidate witnesses,\ncover up evidence, and beat up the women's husbands. Little or nothing is done to prevent\nattacks on rape victims by gangs of upper-caste villagers trying to prevent a case from being\npursued. Sometimes even the policemen join in, the study suggests. Rape victims have also\nbeen murdered. Such crimes often go unpunished.\nDalits are not allowed to drink from the same wells, attend the same temples, wear\nshoes in the presence of an upper caste, or drink from the same cups in tea stalls Untouchables\nare relegated to the lowest jobs, and live in constant fear of being publicly humiliated, paraded\nnaked, beaten, and raped with impunity by upper-caste Hindus seeking to keep them in their\nplace. Merely walking through an upper-caste neighborhood is a life-threatening offense. The\nincidents of violence against dalit barats when the grooms are riding a horse are many. The\ngrooms are thrown off and beaten up.\nThe bias against the dalits by the judiciary was exposed in one case when an upper\ncaste judge allegedly got the chair washed with Ganga water because his predecessor was a\nHarijan!\nIn a school, the upper caste principal would not permit any dalit teacher to sit on a\nchair in his office. He kept all the chairs outside and would get one only for an upper caste\nteacher or visitor. He reasoned that he had got the job by working hard and got 75% marks.\nHow could he allow a 45% one to sit on a chair in front! Strange but not an uncommon\nargument.\nA study carried out in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan focussed on the particular\nvulnerability of socially and economically disadvantaged women to torture and ill-treatment and\nproblems that they face. in accessing justice An emphasis was placed on the situation of\nscheduled caste and scheduled tribe women, given the large populations of these communities in\nthe two states and the existence of specific legislation designed to protect them.\nThe study concluded that this legislation is not being fully implemented.\nThe inference was made on the basis of meetings held with human rights organizations\nand victims of torture and ill-treatment as well as lawyers and others involved in processing\ncases through the criminal justice system. Meetings were also held with officials in the Home\nand Women and Child Departments of the two state governments, as well as police officials in\nthose states. Meetings were also held in Rajasthan with the State Commission for Women and\nthe State Human Rights Commission.\n101\nThese attitudes and behaviour against dalits and the failure of the laws- general or\nspecific, declarartions-national or international- to provide succour to women have also been\namply proved in most of the cases we have studied in Rajasthan.\nAs we have seen in our interviews with lawyers and judges, they are of the view that the\nScheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 is being\nmisused. However, it has come out in this report that the Act is not being used to the extent\nneeded. Dalits who try to register a first information report about an offence are faced with\ninsurmountable obstacles. The police are arrogant and offensive. A majority of criminal cases do\nnot get registered at all. The interviewees have frequently told us that when complaints are\nwritten by the police, they materially depart from the incident orally communicated. The names\nof accused persons will be found missing. The description of the atrocity will be diluted. The\nactual words of abuse will be omitted. Finally, the police will threaten the victim with a counter\ncase against her or her husband.\nThe Act was to prevent atrocities against SC/STs but it has failed to live up to its\nexpectations.\nMore than 75% of cases brought under the Act end in acquittals at all levels. In 2002, out\nof the total cases filed , only 21.72% were disposed off , out of which only 2.31% ended in\nconviction. A Special Court has been set up but these courts did not get the power of admission\nof complaints. They can take it up only when committed by a magistrate under Section 193 of\nCrPC. The situation is further aggravated by Rule 7(1) of the Rules framed under the Act in\n1995 that the investigations under the Act cannot be done by an officer below the rank of a\nDySP. There is a perpetual shortfall of police officers of this rank in the country with the result\nthat either there are delays or the investigations are actually done by junior officer in the name of\nthe Dy. S.P.\nDespite the fact that untouchability was officially banned when India adopted its\nconstitution in 1950, discrimination against Dalits remained so pervasive that in 1989 the\ngovernment passed legislation known as The Prevention of Atrocities Act. The Act specifically\nmade it illegal to parade people naked through the streets, force them to eat feces, take away\ntheir land, foul their water, interfere with their right to vote, and burn down their homes\nWhile the IPC provisions concerning rape are on paper available to women from all\nbackgrounds in India, there are also special provisions in law which apply to sections of society,\nincluding women, who are deemed to be particularly vulnerable to abuses. Special protection\nexists in law for members of scheduled caste and scheduled tribe communities (See the Main\nfeatures in Annexure-3). The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities)\nAct, 1989 was enacted in order \"to prevent the commission of offences of atrocities against the\n102\nmembers of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, to provide for special courts for the\ntrial of such offences and for the relief and rehabilitation of the victims of such offences and for\nmatters connected therewith or incidental thereto\". Sub-sections of section 3(1) of the Act\nspecifies ''atrocities'' against scheduled castes and scheduled tribes which are punishable with\nimprisonment of a minimum of six months and maximum of five years, and with a fine. While\nmany of these atrocities are intended to protect men and women alike, some are specific to\nwomen (i.e. the assault or use of force against a women with intent to dishonour or outrage her\nmodesty or using a position of dominance over a woman to exploit her sexually) or are atrocities\nto which women are particularly vulnerable -- being stripped and paraded naked. Government\nofficials have a central role to play in the implementation of the Act which contains a list of\nprescriptive measures, described as \"the duty of the government to ensure effective\nimplementation of the Act\". Listed in Section 21(2) are some of the measures which include the\nprovision of legal aid, expenses for the witness and victims of atrocities, the provision of\neconomic and social rehabilitation to the victims, the appointment of officers to supervise the\naction, periodic surveys, and special measures. The state government is instructed to designate\none Sessions Court in each district to be a Special Court for trial of persons accused of offences\nunder the Act.\nThe Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules, 1995(22)\nprovide for reactive, preventive and promotional measures that can be taken in an effort to\nensure that there is redress for the violations of the rights of scheduled castes and scheduled\ntribes and that such violations do not recur.\nThe Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules strengthen\nthe procedures in the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) for the recording of an offence by the\npolice, and specify that the officer-in-charge of a police station should record any offence under\nthe Act, whether given verbally or in writing and give a copy to the informant, free of charge.\nRecognising the difficulties that a person may have in registering an offence under the Act, rule\n5(3) states: \"Any person aggrieved by a refusal on the part of an officer in-charge of a police\nstation to record the information ... may send the substance of such information, in writing and\nby post, to the Superintendent of Police concerned who after investigation either by himself or\nby a police officer not below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police, shall make an order\nin writing to the officer in-charge of the concerned police station to enter the substance of that\ninformation to be entered in the book to be maintained in that police station.\"\n103\nNo Change in the Mindset of Perpetrators of Crimes against Women\nIn addition to Indian Acts like the PCR Act, the SC/ST Act, etc, there have been a\nnumber of international declarations to safeguard the body and property of women.\nThe Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, adopted by the UN\nGeneral Assembly in 1993, affirms that states must \"exercise due diligence to prevent,\ninvestigate and, in accordance with national legislation, punish acts of violence against women,\nwhether those acts are perpetrated by the State or by private persons\".\nSpecific groups such as dalits, adivasis \"backward castes\" and others continue to be most\nsocially and economically vulnerable as a result of lack of access to land ownership, meaningful\npolitical participation and free employment. In our survey also we have seen the poor land\nownership, lesser voter turnout during elections to all the three tiers of governance- central, state\nand panchayati raj and most dalit women employed as agricultural labourers in Rajasthan. Sixty-\nsix per cent of all women agricultural labourers are dalits earning between Rs.8-25 per day. Dalit\nwomen, and often children, dominate certain spheres of work, such as civic sanitation,\nscavenging and leatherwork. Women bear the brunt of caste-based atrocities.\nWell-known journalist P. Sainath, after researching the situation of dalits in Rajasthan,\nreported that on average a dalit woman is raped every sixty hours and that one dalit is murdered\nevery nine days. Atrocities on dalit women are an increasing trend. They are victims of landlord\noppression, police excesses and goondaism. In all instances of caste tensions dalit women are\nvictimised. In our study, we have come across many instances of women who stood against the\nlocal landlords or supported inter-caste marriage but wre punished by being paraded naked. One\nreads about these incidents almost every day in the newspapers.\nA study of the experiences of women panchayat members in four districts of Rajasthan\nfound that many women had been subjected to abuse and violence within the panchayat. ''In\nPyari Devi Balai's panchayat, Mokhunda, the Upsarpanch, ran the affairs of the panchayat in the\nbeginning. When some scandals involving embezzlement came to light, Pyari Devi took over the\ncontrol of the panchayat. Since then he has gone against her. He would hurl casteist abuses at\nher and practice untouchability with her. He would say: \u2018 A low caste woman cannot be the\nSarpanch ever\u2019. He asks her- \u2018Have your grandfathers become sarpanches ever?\u2019\nResposibility of Police Officials and Advocate\nUnder the Act, the investigation is to be done by a police officer not lower in rank than\na Deputy Superintendent of Police. However, in many cases the investigation is actually done by\njunior officers and these trials are invariably quashed. On the filing of a chargesheet, bail is\ninvariably granted. Immediately on their release, they begin threatening the complainants,\n104\nforcing them to withdraw the complaint or turn hostile in court. When a Dalit woman persists\nwith a criminal case, a social and economic boycott begins of the entire family. The services of\nDalit labourers connected with the complainant are invariably terminated and they find no\nemployment. Shops do not sell them goods. Ultimately, they are forced to leave the village or\nface terrible physical reprisal. Then come the prosecutors to mess up the litigation further. As we\nhave seen in our focused group discussions, drawn mainly from the upper castes, they\nimmediately identify with the accused and begin sabotaging the criminal trial. They do not\nsummon the relevant witnesses. They advise witnesses for the prosecution to make such\nstatements as will weaken the prosecution's case. They do not produce relevant forensic\nevidence available to them. Finally, they argue with a lack of conviction so as to indicate to the\njudge that the case lacks merits. Truly, the entire judicial system, where dalit women are so\nunder-represented, operates unequally against the victims of these most heinous crimes. It is no\nwonder that Dalit lawyers throughout the country have repeatedly made the demand that there\nshould be reservation for SC/STs judges. But the government have uniformly rejected this\ndemand. As a result, the Act remains unimplemented with judges, lawyers, prosecutors, and\npolicemen hardly interested in the implementation of the statute.\nA system of social audit by government is sorely needed. But if the Act is hardly being\nused, why does the legal fraternity propagate the myth that the Act is being misused? The\nanswer to this lies in the deep-rooted nature of casteism in our country. Filthy abuse is common.\nForcing Dalits to vote against their will for an upper caste candidate is common.\nAfter the Supreme Court made it mandatory for the mid-day meal to be served in every\nprimary school, the upper castes were most unhappy that their children had to sit and eat\ntogether with the scheduled castes and they were even more offended when the cooks and\nhelpers appointed under the orders of the Supreme Court were Dalits. We have seen scores of\nsuch incidents in our enquiry.\nThough the Act is a marvelous piece of legislation, none of the sub-sections of section\n3\u2014which lists the atrocities\u2014are used by the police save section (X) that deals with insults in a\npublic place. We have found that the provisions relating to forfeiture of property of accused\npersons, the removal of persons likely to commit an offence from the area and the imposition of\na collective fine have never been used. Under Section 18 of the Act anticipatory bail cannot be\ngranted, yet there are many instances of grant of bail reported to us by the victims and their\nfamilies.\nUnder the rules, the authorities are to take proactive steps to prevent atrocities from\ntaking place. They are required to visit the area, cancel the gun licenses of the upper castes, seize\nfirearms, set up vigilance committees and deploy special police forces. After the atrocity takes\n105\nplace the authorities are to draw up a list of victims, prepare a detailed report of the loss and\ndamage to the property of victims, provide protection to witnesses, provide immediate relief in\nthe form of cash, food, water, clothing, shelter, medical aid, compensation and transport\nfacilities. Every state government is required to provide for relief including, allotment of\nagricultural land and house sites, government employment, pension for widows and other\ndependents, houses, compensation and healthcare facilities. None of these provisions have ever\nbeen followed.\nThe practice of justice for marginalised women\nOur study has clearly brought out that attempts by dalit women to seek justice through\nthe criminal justice system are regularly forestalled. Although legislation exists, measures to\nensure its full implementation -- including communicating provisions to the public, training\nofficials responsible for administering the legislation, providing legal support services to enable\nbeneficiaries to invoke legislation, monitoring implementation and ensuring further development\nof legislation in response to the reality on the ground -- have not been sufficient. Every victim of\nviolence has told our team that she would have been greatly benefited if she had knowledge\nabout law, especially, how to write an FIR in case of rape, injury, etc. She had to depend totally\non the police officials. They did not seek police help till a male relative was available to\naccompany them to the police station. Unless supported by male relatives or a strong social\ngroup, women victims of crime are at a severe disadvantage within the criminal justice system.\nThreats and harassment by perpetrators and their communities and social pressures which exist\nwithin families and communities force them towards compromise or withdrawal rather than\npursuing justice. Gender biases which exist within institutions of redress are often exacerbated\nby ingrained caste and other biases against members of disadvantaged communities.\n\u2018Not many of these cases reach the courts for trial, partly in view of the shame and\nhonour involved and partly due to the existing difficult and complicated procedural laws. It was\nalso noticed that the police are generally apathetic to the registration of complaints involving\nrape. Even in those cases which come up to courts for trial after going through all the\ninvestigations and medical examinations; our courts had not been sensitive to the trauma\nundergone by the rape victims, both during the actual commission of the offence and during trial\nin the courts. The courts are also oblivious of the social stigma and ostracism a victim of rape\nhas to face throughout her life. Most rapists are acquitted on wholly irrelevant and flimsy\ngrounds of age, religion, caste, status and other considerations.\u2019\n[National Commission for Women Annual Report for 1995-96]\nThe difficulties for a dalit victim start early.\n106\na. Registering a complaint\nNon-registration of crimes is a general problem we find in Rajasthan. Political influence\nover the police and caste, class, religious and gender biases mean that it is extremely difficult for\ndalit women to file complaints, particularly against individuals from powerful caste groups. A\ncase cannot continue and a victim cannot receive justice if a First Information Report (FIR) is\nnot completed and registered by police on the basis of a person's complaint.\nA large number of cases were not reported to police for fear of dishonour or reprisals.\nMost women visit a police station with a male relative only or wait for him till he returns from\nwork and will think twice about making a complaint without the support of a male relative. Most\nof the rape cases, therefore, fall through owing to the delay and the resultant destruction of the\nevidence by the time an FIR gets registered by the police.\nPolice are reluctant to file FIRs citing offences under the Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, because the perpetrators -- often\npowerful individuals within the community or even caste group to which police officers\nthemselves belong -- receive such stringent punishments. This seriousness of action was\ncorroborated during my meetings with district officials who stressed that they did not take the\ncases under the SC/ST Act brought to them lightly and followed the exact procedure laid down\nin the Act.\nWhile many of the victims pursue their complaints with higher authorities having been\nrefused at their local police station, if supported by their families, caste groups and voluntary\norganizations, in many cases the directions of higher authorities are either ignored or given a lip\nservice by the local police officials. This was stated by many victims and their families during\ncase studies. The pressures from the politically powerful or senior administrative officers can\nmake the local police officials to register the FIR or at the most to arrest the accused, but in most\ncases that is the end of action by them. We have also seen that complaints made to the Human\nRights Commission are very few in number (Annexure-2). Those made are processed quickly\nbut the procedure followed is routine and is hardly pro-active. The complaints are sent to the\npolice and if the Superintendent of Police sends a reply that the case has been registered and that\nthe investigations have started, the complaint is filed and no follow up action is taken. The Hon.\nChairman of the Rajasthan Human Rights Commission told me that the Commission should not\nbe considered as a Court.\n107\nb. Getting an Immediate and Unbiased Medical Examination\nPoor access to medical facilities necessary to document violence, including rape, is also a\nproblem. Health centres in Rajasthan are widely dispersed, often scarce in rural areas and are\nunderstaffed leading to delays which mean that valuable evidence is lost. Obtaining sufficient\nevidence to prove rape -- as strictly defined in Indian law and by the courts as penetration by the\npenis -- can be very difficult. However, while prompt medical examination can provide strong,\nand in some cases irrefutable evidence, a victim's testimony also constitutes vital evidence.\nContrary to the apparent view of many judicial officers in India, lack of medical evidence of\nsexual penetration should not refute an allegation of sexual abuse. Unfortunately, the legal\nassistance to the dalit victim is so weak that her testimony in the court is unable to convince the\ncourt. As most of the incidents take place in isolated spots, there is seldom an eye witness.\nc. Time and money\nThe length of time it takes to pursue a case through the courts encourages victims to\nmake compromises under pressure from perpetrators and often their own community or family.\nAll lawyers and activists interviewed by us spoke of the reluctance of victims to file cases\nbecause of the time and money involved. There are often significant distances between the\nvillage where a victim lives and the munsif court where a case is heard. Money is lost in\nattending hearings not just on travel expenses but lost working hours for those women working\nas daily labour and their male relatives who accompany them to the hearings.\nThe Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules provide for\ntransport and other expenses for victims to enable them to attend hearings and in the case of\nwomen for an attendant to accompany them and covering of wages lost during days attending\nhearings. Often women simply do not have the money to pursue a case and having no economic\nindependence, if their families do not support them in pursuing the case they drop it.\nIt is clear that time and money involved in pursuing cases leads to a large number of\nwomen deciding not to file complaints or to withdraw complaints once filed. The long time\nperiods allow victims to feel the effects of social ostracisation, harassment and intimidation and\nfor witnesses to withdraw their testimony under similar pressures.\nThe legal aid system in Rajasthan is entirely inadequate to deal with the number of\npeople who require legal aid. This is particularly the case for women victims of crime. Under the\nLegal Services Authorities Act 1987, a wide range of groups including members of scheduled\ncastes or scheduled tribes, women and children are all entitled to legal services. It is common\nknowledge that legal aid cases are given to the worst lawyers and, even if not taking legal aid,\npoor victims are at the mercy of unscrupulous lawyers who exploit their lack of knowledge of\n108\nthe legal system. They take money from both the sides. We found that most of the lawyers\npressurized the victims to agree to a compromise or getting the case withdrawn as \u2018 not\nhappened\u2019 and share the compromise booty paid by the accused. A perusal of the compensation\npaid by the Government in Table shows that it is far less than the real expenditure.\nPolice officers have their own caste and gender biases and often behave towards dalits\nand adivasis in a discriminatory way -- acting within the norms of their social surroundings.\nOfficials in Rajasthan also acknowledged that gender sensitivity is not institutionalised within\nthe police force\nThe state must train police and other state officials to separate their caste, gender and\nother prejudices from their duty to protect citizens, if legislative and administrative policies are\nto have any meaning. The state cannot afford to overlook this problem any longer otherwise all\nits sincere efforts will be wasted. A large number of cases of violence against women after the\nfiling of an FIR were subsequently logged as found \"false\" after investigation. The labeling of\nthese cases as \"false\" is itself a concern as it implies that women have falsely or maliciously\nfiled the cases and plays into the hands of those who argue that women misuse legal provisions\nto wrongfully accuse men as a means of punishment. In fact, government and police officials\nagree that it usually means that the victim had already reached a compromise with the\nperpetrator of violence. The Rajasthan government indicated that 30% of all cases of crimes\nagainst women in the state had been found to be \"false\" after investigation.\nSection 15 of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act\nprovides for the state government to specify a public prosecutor or appoint an advocate. It has\nbeen seen that public prosecutors regard cases of poor women as easy money. There is little\ncommunication with the victims and it is common for prosecutors to take money from the\naccused's side in return for putting pressure on the victim to compromise or withdraw the\ncomplaint. The judiciary also fails to take sufficient care in cross-questioning witnesses and\ninvestigating officers during hearings.\nJudicial decisions have also shown clear bias against women. In the now famous verdict\ngiven in November 1995, a lower court in Rajasthan commented that an incident of alleged rape\ncould not have taken place because upper caste men would not rape a woman of a lower caste\nand acquitted the alleged perpetrators. The case is universally known as the Bhanwari Devi case,\nthe decision in which was widely criticized. The case has been mentioned earlier also in this\nreport.\nBhanwari Devi, a saathin, working to eradicate child marriages in the state-sponsored\nWomen's Development Programme, was raped on 22 September 1992 in Bhateri village,\nRajasthan, by five men of a higher Gujjar caste. The rape was widely seen as punishment for her\n109\nactions in preventing a particular child marriage which occurred in the village. Police had come\nto the village and attempted to stop the marriage, which had already secretly taken place, and the\nGurjars held Bhanwari Devi responsible for the police intervention.\nThe police initially refused to record Bhanwari Devi's statement. She was also initially\nprevented from undergoing a medical examination. After much protest, the government ordered\nan inquiry to be carried out by the Central Bureau of Investigation. It finished its investigation in\nSeptember 1993 but was reported to have subjected Bhanwari Devi to unnecessarily excessive\nquestioning about the incident. It found Bhanwari Devi's allegations to be true and chargesheets\nwere filed against five men. The trial began in a lower court only in October 1994. In a verdict\ngiven in November 1995, the Court found that the delay in filing her complaint with police and\nin obtaining a medical examination indicated that she had made the story up. Shockingly, it\ncommented that the incident could not have taken place because upper caste men, including a\nBrahmin, would not rape a woman of a lower caste. The men were acquitted of the charge of\ngang rape but convicted of minor crimes.\nBhanwari Devi has been ostracised from the village community since the incident in\n1992. Pressure was continuously put on her by members of the local community as well as\npoliticians to withdraw the case\nIn an analysis of cases affecting dalit women in the first half of 2005, the police is\nreported to have claimed that 44% cases of atrocities and 63% of Kidnapping were false.\nWomen\u2019s organizations in Rajasthan are asking as to why when the national figures of \u2018false\u2019\ncases are only 10%, why is the false percentage so high in Rajasthan. The biggest reason why\nwomen withdraw the cases is their abject poverty, lack of social support and high illiteracy.\nThey cannot annoy their in-laws and have already lost all support from their parents after\nmarriage. In a number of cases, the victims told our investigators that they were under constant\nfear of being thrown out of their husband\u2019s home. In a number of cases it did happen.\nThe police officials say that the truth can come out only if the monetary compensation to\na victim is paid if she does not change her statement u/s 164CrPC from the one given to the\npolice u/s 161 CrPC. But our experience shows that the change is not because she told a lie\nearlier but because she is under fear of bodily harm and emotional and physical ostracism if she\ndoes not retract her statement.\nOn the same logic the police should also not agree to a compromise once they have\nconvincing evidence against the accused. Once a challan is put up, let the court decide.\nIn a few cases reported in \u2018Ujala Chhadi\u2019, the police went out of its way to save the\nperpetrators of rape of minor girls. In one, the section of Rape was not mentioned in the FIR in\nthe beginning till the court directed them to do so. Instead the case was closed and no challan put\n110\nup. The minor girl gave birth to a child but the rapist is freely moving about. In another case the\nSHO pretended to be sleeping when the parents of the minor victim went to report. When he\nwork up he told them just to sign on a piece of paper as he would write the report himself. He\nnever read out to the parents what he had written. Nothing further was done by the police and\nthe Rajput culprit was let off.\nIn Jaipur, a Brahmin, 22 year old, raped a minor. The police mentioned his age as 16\nyears and got him punished only under the Juvenile Act.\nIn Jhunjhunu, the four year old victim of rape recognized the rapist twice in the\nidentification parade but he was not arrested till the entire public got together in support of the\nvictim.\nAll the victims are still in trauma. One of them screams in her sleep and cannot look at a\nman in pyjamas without utter fear.\nThe Hague Declaration on the Human Rights and the Dignity of Dalit Women\nThe Hague, 21 November 2006\nThe Declaration on the Human Rights and Dignity of Dalit Women stated that in South\nAsia dalits have endured discrimination based on work and descent for centuries, and this\ndiscrimination continues today. The Dalits \u2013 known as \u2018untouchables\u2019 or outcastes \u2013 number\naround two hundred and sixty million in South Asia. On account of their caste, they experience\ndiscrimination, social exclusion and violence on a daily basis. Although economic growth in the\nregion has been strong over the past decade, caste disparities remain and are in fact increasing.\nThe situation of Dalit women in these countries needs urgent and special attention. They\nconstitute one of the largest socially segregated groups anywhere in the world and face systemic\nand structural discrimination thrice over: as Dalits, as women, and as poor.\nSystemic Discrimination, Violence and Impunity\nThe caste system declares Dalit women to be intrinsically impure and \u2018untouchable\u2018,\ntherefore socially excluded. In class terms, the vast majority of Dalit women are poor; many are\nlandless daily wage labourers who are systematically denied access to resources. As women,\nthey are subjugated by patriarchal structures. Due to this intersectional discrimination, Dalit\nwomen are specifically targeted for daily, egregious acts of violence, in particular for sexual\nviolence, including the Devadasi system of forced and ritualised prostitution. On account of their\n\u2018impure\u2019 caste and poverty, Dalit women comprise the majority of manual scavengers, that is,\nlabourers who clean human excrement from dry toilets. When they assert their fundamental\nrights, Dalit women are targeted for punitive violence by dominant castes. Due to patriarchal\n111\nnotions of community honour residing in women, dominant caste violence against Dalit women\nfunctions to punish the entire Dalit community and teach Dalits a lesson of obedience to caste\nnorms. Moreover, Dalit women are discriminated against not only by dominant castes on\naccount of their caste, class and gender, but also by their own communities on account of their\ngender. Dalit women have less power within the Dalit community in general.\nWhen considering discrimination and violence against Dalit women, one can state that\nimpunity is the key problem Dalit women face today \u2013 not only while seeking legal and judicial\nredress for violence, but also while attempting to access and enjoy their fundamental rights and\nfreedoms. Perpetrators enjoy virtual immunity from prosecution for violence against Dalit\nwomen, as the police, who themselves often harbour caste prejudices, wilfully neglect to enforce\nthe law. Not only the police, but perpetrators and their communities use their political, social\nand economic power to silence Dalit women, thereby denying them access to justice.\n112\nCHAPTER VI\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nPolicy Issues -\n- Disaggregate all criminal, economic, social and political data on the grounds of\ngender and caste.\n- Evolve and implement a comprehensive strategy to address impunity and ensure\ncriminal justice for Dalit women.\n- Grant powers to make legally binding recommendations to relevant National Human\nRights Institutions to establish an independent complaints and monitoring mechanism\nto address the discrimination and violence against Dalit women.\n- Enact domestic violence (prevention and protection) laws that acknowledge the\nunique vulnerability of Dalit women, allocate adequate resources and ensure a\ncomprehensive monitoring mechanism with representation of Dalit women for\neffective implementation of these laws.\n- Provide support to establish informal organisations for Dalit women to freely discuss\nthe social, domestic and development issues in their own community and to\nstrengthen leadership within local governance structures.\n- Mandate proportional representation of Dalit women elected into parliaments,\nlegislatures and local governance systems, including equal distribution of other\nminority groups, such as Joginis / Badis (India/Nepal) irrespective of their faith, and\nprovide adequate budget allocations in this regard.\nLaws issue - SC/ST Act 1989:\nAction points for better enforcement of Schedueled castes and Scheduled TribesT\n- Machinery to effectively enforce provisions of Scheduled Castes & Scheduled Tribes\n(Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989 would need to be made more stringent at\ngrassroots level i.e. Police Stations by creating a separate cell to be manned by\nSC/ST officials for dealing such cases.\n- Section 4 of the Scheduled Castes & Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act\n1989, which relates to \u2018Punishment for neglect of duties\u2019 needs to be amended to\ninclude public servants belonging to SCs & STs.\n113\n- Not more than 10% cases registered under the Protection of Civil Rights Act 1995\nend in conviction in the lower courts, which questions the fairness on the part of\ninvestigations, trial and judicial decisions. There is hardly any instance where State\nGovts have filed any appeal before the High Courts against decision of the lower\ncourts on PCR Act cases. There should be proper directions to the States to review\nall such cases to find out why an appeal against the judgments of the lower courts\ncould not be filed in High Courts/Supreme Courts.\n- Though there are special cells for investigation of cases registered under SC/ST\natrocity act in certain states including Rajasthan headed by Additional General of\nPolice but they are ineffective because they have only inquiring and supervising\nauthority. They have no authority to charge sheet the case in the court of law. The\ngovernment of India provides 50% expenditure for maintaining this special enquiry\ncell and 50% share of expenditure is expected to be borne by the state governments,\ntherefore, the state governments do not take much interest in strengthening this\ndepartment. It is recommended that 100% expenditure on the enforcement of SC/ST\nAct from police station level to court level should be borne by the government of\nIndia. For fighting cases of the SC/ST , free legal aid has been introduced. This has\nhowever, been reduced to a mere formality resulting in SC/ST people continuing to\nlanguishing in jail as under trials for long without even being prosecuted and\nsentenced. No one comes forward to get him or her released on bail even in petty\noffences.\nThe Last Word\n\u201cUnless the sarvarnas and Dalits effect reconciliation, society will suffer from cycles of\nrevenge and counter-revenge. They have to assert their rights and move up from within the\nsystem. Laws have failed to change the attitude of people, and contemporary religious leaders\nhave done precious little to remove the prejudices and bring about reconciliation.\n\u201cHistorically many of the revered rishis were Dalits. For instance, the narrator of the\nPuranas, Soot Maharishi, was a Dalit. Shaabara Rishi born into an \u2018atishudra\u2019 family was highly\nrevered as a rishi. The current generation of upper castes is not exposed to this information and\nthat is the reason why, in the villages, people continue to indulge in inhuman practices.\n\u201cEvery morning, the first puja of the day in the Tirupati temple is offered by the\nscheduled caste Banjara community. It would be good to start this practice in other temples\nwhere there is discrimination. The oppressors need to be taught that what they claim to be their\n114\nown has major contributions from the Dalits. As Maharishi Dayanand, Shri Aurobindo and\nmany others have rightly pointed out religious practices have drifted away from their\nphilosophy.\n\u201cManu Smriti is only a code of conduct given by a king and has nothing to do with the\nShrutis, Vedas or the Upanishads. It is time to honour the philosophy and discard the\nunscrupulous practices. Instead, people have discarded the philosophy and allowed the\nunscrupulous practices to continue.\n\u201cThe greatest of the epics \u2013 the Ramayana \u2013 was written by a Dalit. The vicious cycle of\nhatred and revenge is being promoted for political gains.\u201d\nShri Shri Ravishankar. Hindustan Times.

    "content": "The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 is a law made by the Government of India to protect people\u2014especially women\u2014from abuse at home. It is not only about physical harm but also includes emotional, mental, sexual, and financial abuse. Many people think abuse only means hitting or beating, but this law shows that even controlling someone's money, insulting them every day, or stopping them from going to work is also abuse.\nThis law helps people living in rural, semi-urban, or urban areas. It is meant for everyone\u2014whether you are a housewife, daily wage worker, shopkeeper, student, or from the LGBTQ+ community. Even if you are not legally married (for example, in a live-in relationship), you are still protected under this law.\nUnder this law, any woman who feels unsafe in her home can file a complaint against her husband, partner, or even in-laws. The law defines \"domestic violence\" as:\nPhysical abuse (hitting, slapping, pushing, etc.)\nEmotional abuse (insulting, threatening, or blaming)\nSexual abuse (forcing someone for sex without consent)\nEconomic abuse (not giving money, taking away salary or property)\nThe law allows women to continue living in their shared house. No one can throw them out. If needed, the court can order the abuser to move out or stay away. Women can also ask for money to take care of themselves and their children.\nWhy This Law is Special:\nYou don\u2019t have to file a police FIR to use this law.\nThe court gives civil orders to protect you first.\nThis law can be used along with IPC Section 498A or other criminal laws if the violence is severe.\n\nHow to Get Help? You can approach:\nLocal Police Station\nProtection Officer in your district\nNearest Magistrate Court\nOne-Stop Crisis Centre or NGO\nThis law is a step towards protecting dignity and safety inside the home. If you are suffering silently, know that the law stands with you. Help is available.\n"

    "content": "Intro: \nMany survivors of domestic violence are unsure whether they should go to the police or to the court. Some do not know the difference between a civil case and a criminal case. This confusion is common, especially in rural and semi-urban areas, and it can delay getting the right help. Understanding the difference between civil and criminal cases helps a survivor take the right step, avoid unnecessary fear, and get the kind of protection or justice they truly need.\nThis section will help you understand both types of cases clearly\u2014what they are, when to file them, what happens in each case, and what you can expect as a result.\nWhat is a Civil Case in Domestic Violence?\nA civil case is filed when someone wants protection or support from the court, but does not want to punish the abuser with jail or criminal charges. In the context of domestic violence, the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (PWDVA), is a civil law. It is focused on protecting the victim and providing relief such as safety, housing, money, and custody of children. The purpose of a civil case is not to send someone to jail but to make sure the victim can live safely and with dignity.\nCivil domestic violence cases are usually filed in Magistrate Courts. The survivor can approach a Protection Officer, an NGO, or the court directly. There is no need to go to the police or file an FIR for civil protection. The court can pass emergency orders, often within three days, and the full case is usually decided within 60 to 90 days.\nUnder a civil DV case, the survivor can ask for the following reliefs:\nA protection order stopping the abuser from contacting or coming near the survivor\nA residence order allowing the survivor to stay in the shared home\nMonetary support for food, rent, and children\u2019s needs\nTemporary custody of children\nCompensation for physical or emotional harm\nWhat is a Criminal Case in Domestic Violence?\nA criminal case is filed when the survivor wants the abuser to be punished by law. This happens when there is serious violence, dowry harassment, threats, or suspicious death involved. Criminal cases are filed at the police station by registering an FIR (First Information Report). These cases fall under the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\nThe goal of a criminal case is to punish the wrongdoer. The police investigate, collect evidence, and present the case in a criminal court. If proven guilty, the abuser may be fined, jailed, or both. The process may take longer because the court requires strong proof like medical records, witness statements, and physical evidence.\nCommon IPC sections used in domestic violence-related criminal cases include:\nSection 498A for cruelty by husband or in-laws\nSection 304B for dowry death\nSection 506 for criminal threats\nSection 509 for verbal and sexual insults\nSection 323 for physical harm and injury\nWhen Should You File a Civil Case?\nYou should file a civil case under the Domestic Violence Act when you need immediate safety, protection, or financial support. If your goal is to stop the violence, remain in your home safely, get custody of children, or get maintenance for your expenses, civil law is the right path. Civil protection is also useful for women who do not want their husband or in-laws to be jailed but still want safety and respect.\nYou can file a civil DV case without going to the police. A Protection Officer or local women\u2019s NGO can help you write and submit the complaint. No money is required to file the case.\nWhen Should You File a Criminal Case?\nYou should file a criminal case when the abuse involves severe harm, threats to life, dowry demands, or physical torture. If a woman is being blackmailed, thrown out of her house, forced to bring dowry, or physically injured, she should go to the police station and file an FIR. This allows the police to investigate, arrest the abuser, and start the legal process in a criminal court.\nCriminal cases are also used when a woman dies under suspicious circumstances, especially within seven years of marriage. In such cases, the police must register the case under Section 304B of the IPC and conduct a full inquiry.\nCan You File Both Cases Together?\nYes, in many situations, a woman may file both civil and criminal cases at the same time. The civil case is used for protection, housing, and maintenance, while the criminal case is filed for punishment of the abuser. These two cases can run together in different courts.\nFor example, if a woman is harassed for dowry and beaten, she can file a civil case under the Domestic Violence Act to get safety and money, and at the same time, file a criminal case under 498A IPC for cruelty and dowry harassment. Both actions will help her feel safe and get justice.\nReal-Life Example\nMeena, a woman from a small town, was asked by her husband to bring \u20b91 lakh from her parents. When she refused, he beat her and locked her in a room. She approached an NGO who helped her file two cases:\nA civil case under the Domestic Violence Act to stay in the shared house and get \u20b92,000 per month\nA criminal FIR under 498A IPC for cruelty and dowry pressure\nAs a result, she was given protection and financial help, and her husband was legally held accountable.\nFinal Understanding\nCivil cases are about safety. Criminal cases are about punishment. You do not have to choose just one path. Depending on your situation, you may use both together. Many survivors do not know this, which is why this tab is designed to clear your confusion and help you choose the right legal remedy.\nBoth paths are valid, and both are available to you. You are not alone, and the law is on your side\n"

Abuse can happen in many forms and can happen to any gender\u2014 and it can happen in homes, relationships, and even online.\nGoal is to help users understand the broad definition of abuse and its different forms with examples.\n\nTypes of abuse : \nPhysical abuse : \nPerhaps the most recognized form, physical abuse may include behaviors such as:\nHitting, slapping, punching, kicking\nBurning\nStrangulation\nDamaging personal property\nRefusing medical care and/or controlling medication\nCoercing partner into substance abuse\nUse of weapons\n\nEmotional/Verbal abuse: \nEmotional abuse occurs when an intimate partner seeks to control their loved one by:\nName calling, insulting\nBlaming the partner for everything\nExtreme jealousy\nIntimidation\nShaming, humiliating\nIsolation\nControlling what the partner does and where the partner goes\nStalking\n\nSexual abuse: \n    Emotional abuse occurs when an intimate partner seeks to control their loved one by:\nName calling, insulting\nBlaming the partner for everything\nExtreme jealousy\nIntimidation\nShaming, humiliating\nIsolation\nControlling what the partner does and where the partner goes\nStalking\n\n\n\n\nFinancial abuse: \nAny behavior that maintains power and control over finances constitutes financial abuse. Examples include:\nInflicting physical harm or injury that would prevent the person from attending work\nHarassing partner at their workplace\nControlling financial assets and effectively putting partner on an allowance\nDamaging a partner\u2019s credit score\n\nDowry related abuse: \nDowry abuse is the harassment or violence a woman faces from her husband or in-laws over dowry demands.\nExamples include :\nBeating or threats for not bringing enough dowry.\nConstant taunts about \u201cinsufficient\u201d gifts.\nSuspicious deaths soon after marriage (dowry deaths).\nPressure for car, cash, or property even after marriage.\n\n\n\n\nDigital abuse: \nThis form of abuse includes the use of technology to control and stalk a partner.

    "content": "Description: \nWarning signs in relationships are early behaviors that indicate control, disrespect, or harm. These signs often appear before abuse becomes serious and should never be ignored.\nUnderstanding the early signs of abuse in relationships is key to preventing long-term harm. \nControlling Behaviour : \nDemands to know where you are at all times.\nTaking away your phone or checking your messages without permission.\nForcing you to stay home or stop working/studying.\nMaking all financial decisions without your input.\nExamples : \nA husband tells his wife she cannot go to her parents\u2019 house without his permission.\nA boyfriend checks his partner\u2019s phone and asks who she talks to.\n\n Isolation from Friends and Family :\nThis happens when a partner tries to cut you off from people who care about you. \nThey may stop you from visiting your family, attending social events, or talking to friends, making you feel lonely and dependent only on them.\nExample:\n A woman is stopped from attending weddings or festivals at her maternal home.\nThe partner creates fights every time the girl speaks to her school friend.\nThreats and fear :\nThe abuser uses threats\u2014like harming themselves, you, or your loved ones\u2014to control you. They may shout, break things, or use anger to scare you into doing what they want, even without physically hurting you.\nExample: \nA man says, \u201cIf you ever leave me, I\u2019ll kill myself and blame you.\nBreaking household items or shouting loudly during arguments to create fear.\nBlaming and guilt tripping : \nThe partner avoids taking responsibility for their actions and instead makes you feel like everything is your fault. They say things like, \u201cYou made me do this,\u201d or \u201cIf you cared, you\u2019d do this for me,\u201d to make you feel guilty and control your choices.\nExample: \n\u201cIf you really loved me, you would do this for me.\u201d\nMaking the partner feel guilty for saying no or expressing needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "content": "Description: \n\nLeaving an abusive relationship is never easy. Many people, especially women in India, stay in abusive homes due to fear, pressure, lack of support, and emotional conditioning. It\u2019s not weakness : : it\u2019s survival.\n\nReasons Why People Stay (Indian Context) : \n\n1. Financial Dependence : \n\n Most women in rural areas are not financially independent.\n Without income, they cannot support themselves or their children: \nExample: A woman endures abuse because she cannot feed her kids if she leaves.\n\n2. Fear of Social Judgment and Shame (\"Log Kya Kahenge?\") : \n\nFear of bringing \u201cshame\u201d to the family or community.\n Society often blames the victim instead of the abuser.\nExample:* Relatives say, \u201cAurat ne hi kuch kiya hoga.\u201d\n\n3. Lack of Family or Legal Support: \n\n Families pressure women to \u201cadjust\u201d and stay married.\n Police often dismiss complaints as \"ghar ka mamla.\"\nExample:* Parents say, \u201cShaadi nibhaani padti hai.\u201d\n\n4. Concern for Children : \n\n Mothers stay to protect children from custody issues or trauma.\nExample: A mother tolerates abuse to keep her children\u2019s future stable.\n\n5. Emotional Attachment and Hope for Change: \n\n Victims may still love the abuser or believe they will change.\n Example: \u201cWoh pehle acche the... shayad fir se waise ho jayein.\u201d\n\n6. Religious and Cultural Beliefs:\n\nDivorce is seen as a sin or social taboo.\nExample: Women are told, \"pati ko bhagwan samjho.\"\n\n\n\n\n7. Lack of Awareness of Rights : \n\nMany don\u2019t know about laws protecting them like the PWDVA or Section 498A.\nExample: A woman believes she can only go to police if badly injured.\n\n8. Emotional Manipulation and Guilt:\n\nAbuser blames the victim or threatens suicide.\nExample: \u201cIf you leave, I\u2019ll die\u201d makes the woman stay out of guilt.\n\n9. Fear of Retaliation or Violence:\n\n Victims fear more violence if they try to leave.\nExample:* \u201cAgar tu chali gayi to tujhe zinda nahi chhodunga.\u201d\n\n10. Nowhere to Go (Lack of Shelter):\n\nNo nearby shelter homes or support networks.\nExample:* A woman has no phone, no money, and no safe place.\n\n\n\nThis is exactly why our project is important. It bridges the gap between awareness and access. Women in rural and semi-urban areas often remain stuck in abusive situations because:\n\nThey don\u2019t know what abuse looks like.\n They don\u2019t know their rights.\n They don\u2019t know where to go.\n\n**Our digital solution** helps women recognize abuse, understand their legal options, and connect them to support systems. We empower them with information, anonymity, and accessibility.\n\nIn places where silence is the norm, our platform becomes their voice.\n\n---\n\n*\"Staying is not your fault. Leaving is difficult, but possible. You deserve safety, dignity, and respect \u2014 not silence and survival.\"*\n\n"
